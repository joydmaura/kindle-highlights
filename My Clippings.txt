It was, perhaps, the one thing I would never show him. Anyone. How I had cowered and raged and wept. How I had vomited, and screamed, and clawed at the mirror. Slammed my fists into it. And then curled up, trembling at every horrific and cruel and selfish thing I’d beheld within that monster—within me. But I had kept watching. I did not turn from it.

We expect these qualities from heroes. But Spenser extends them to heroines, in a way that speaks directly to our time. His armed Amazons, Belphoebe and Britomart, are among the most potent women in literature. Spenser removes the usual archetypal basis of female force, the daemonic, and imagines his heroines as Apollonian angels.

In The Faerie Queene, mutilation is horrific. Words like “misshapen” and “deformitee” recur. The human form is paradigmatic, as in the anatomical architecture of the House of Temperance (II.ix). Belphoebe and Britomart, personified chastity, express their radical autonomy in a blaze of self-generated light, the same light that pours from the Olympian gods as patrons of aristocratic order. The body in Spenser is a social integer. Apollonian illumination and integrity of form are art, politics, and morality all in one. Clarity of eye is purity of being.

So the liberated woman is the symbol of the English Renaissance, as the beautiful boy is the symbol of the Italian. In The Faerie Queene, we see her in free movement. I speak, of course, of artistic projection and not of the life of real British women. But art is what transcends and survives. Of all truths, it is the finest. Belphoebe bursts into The Faerie Queene like a divine epiphany. Spenser gives her one of the most dazzling theatrical entrances in art. Narrative action stops dead, while ten long stanzas minutely describe her appearance. The Apollonian eye is locked in place. It is a privileged moment of hieratic stillness and silence, as if a frame of film were frozen before us.

Belphoebe appears and disappears, like a dream vision. Not till a full book later does Spenser disclose her birth and education. In Book Two, she is formal and abstract, a sudden manifestation of hierarchic power. With her grace, dignity, and arete, she may be a living illustration of the golden mean, the parable of Medina and her sisters in the prior canto. Belphoebe mediates between the extremes of art and nature, masculinity and femininity. Her name means “beautiful Diana.” She carries “deadly tooles,” her male weapons (II.iii.37). We usually see her caught up in bloodlust, fast on the red trail of fleeing prey. A woman of “Heroick mind,” she intimidates by her monomania, evasion of physical contact, and want of ordinary homely emotion.

Exaltation of the Apollonian mode in The Faerie Queene tends to make the virtuous characters somewhat slow-witted! Belphoebe, for example, is given to rather dull speeches. Eloquence belongs to evil characters, like seductively musical Despair (I.ix.38–47).

Let great female deeds awake again, he proclaims (III.iv.1–2). In The Faerie Queene, helpless, retiring femininity is a spiritually deficient persona. Fleeing, ever-receding Florimell, brainwashed by the literary conventions of the love-game, is a caricature of hysterical vulnerability. Terrified by the sound of leaves, she runs even from admirers and rescuers. Spenser values courage and confrontation. Florimell’s timidity and irrational fear are a defect of will.

Female arms and armour are the panoply of sex war. One of the cardinal events of The Faerie Queene is rape, which occurs in dozens of forms, some real, some fabricated. The maidens Una, Belphoebe, Florimell, Amoret, Samient, and Serena are attacked once or repeatedly by rapists. Children born of rape include the sorcerer Merlin, the knights Satyrane and Marinell, and the chivalric triplets Triamond, Priamond, and Diamond. Males too fall victim to rape, kidnapped by the giantess Argante, her brother Ollyphant, and Jove himself. Even avarice is imagined as rape, the sacrilegious wounding of earth’s “quiet wombe” for tinselly silver and gold (II.vii.17). The rape cycle of The Faerie Queene is the most advanced rhetorical structure in Renaissance poetry, surpassed only by Milton’s freezing of epic plot into oratory in Paradise Lost.

The rapes of The Faerie Queene come from Ovid’s Metamorphoses, the most imitated book of the Renaissance. But rape in Ovid, as in Hellenistic and Baroque art, is a bit of a jamboree, a romp of popping male muscles and bursting female globes.

Spenser intellectualizes the Ovidian motif. Rape is his metaphor for biology, for the surges of aggression in nature. The sex war of The Faerie Queene is a Darwinian spectacle of nature red in tooth and claw, of the eaters and the eaten. Bestial Lust and his agents, like the hyena monster stalking Florimell, literally feed on women’s flesh, devouring their bodies. Woman is meat, and the penis, symbolized in oak logs brandished by Lust and Orgoglio, is a thing, a weapon.

Amoret’s inability to defend herself shows she is incomplete. Assaulted by Lust, she shrieks, in a striking display of lack of animal energy, too “feebly” to wake the sleeping Britomart (IV.vii.4). And Amoret is grotesquely defenseless against the sorcerer Busyrane, who binds her to a pillar, slashes open her naked breast, and extracts from “that wide orifice her trembling heart,” laying it in a silver basin (III.xii.20–21). This episode, one of the most decadent in The Faerie Queene, is a formal spectacle of eroticized masochism.

The Faerie Queene is pulled in two directions, one Protestant, one pagan. Spenser wants good to come out of noble action. But sexual personae have a will of their own. The spectral sex signs of western art are vaunting creatures of hostility and egotism. The Faerie Queene’s harsh clangor of combat is our native music. Spenser’s contradictions are uneasiest in his nature theory. He glorifies woman, but her body is a morass in which action is lost.

It has usually been misread (though not by A. C. Hamilton) as slipshod bad taste. But this Roman drama of rape and mutilation turns the Spenserian rape cycle into slapstick comedy. It is hilariously, intentionally funny. The ravished Lavinia doggedly persists in waving her “stumps” about like a windmill. Like Wilde’s Apollonian The Importance of Being Earnest, Titus Andronicus should be played by romping drag queens, so that its outrageous mannerisms clearly emerge. This play is Shakespeare’s taunting farewell to Spenser. He is about to launch his own original explorations of love and gender.

Spenser is an iconicist, Shakespeare a dramaturge. Spenser is ruled by the eye, Shakespeare by the ear. Spenser is an Apollonian, presenting his personae in a linear series of epiphanies, carved out by the Botticellian hard edge. He makes tableaux, episodic vignettes, so loosely connected by plot that no one can ever remember what happens when.

Spenser, like Vergil, turns to epic at a moment of sudden anarchic multiplication of sexual personae. We will see Blake similarly responding to the psychological crisis which is Romanticism. Multiplicity of persona, random role-experimentation, is always evil in The Faerie Queene.

Positive Spenserian hermaphroditism is never fluid and improvisational, as it is in Shakespeare, but rather formalized, frozen, and emblematic, as in Britomart’s phallic spear or the Isis idol’s “long white slender wand” (V.vii.7). Shakespeare responds to Spenser’s archaism with dynamic futurism.

Language and personae mirror each other in both Spenser and Shakespeare. The archaizing language of The Faerie Queene is analogous to the Apollonian unity of its armoured personalities. Belphoebe and Britomart have one line of thought, as they have one line of action. They are not besieged by fantasy or mood, by the rising torrent of imagination surging through Shakespeare’s major characters.

But Shakespeare’s characters are forever changing their clothes, especially in the comedies. Shakespeare takes the inherited theme of mistaken identity, as old as Menander and Plautus, and turns it into a meditation on Renaissance role-playing. He is the first to reflect upon the fluid nature of modern gender and identity.

the watery “bath” of the opus was a hierosgamos or coniunctio (“sacred marriage” or “union”), a “chymical wedding” of male and female.

We earlier traced the idea of the “mercurial” to crafty, wing-footed Hermes. My Mercurius, first conceived by Shakespeare, is the androgynous spirit of impersonation, the living embodiment of multiplicity of persona. Mercurius possesses verbal and therefore mental power. Shakespeare’s great Mercurius androgyne is the transvestite Rosalind and after her the male-willed Cleopatra. The main characteristic is an electric wit, dazzling, triumphant, euphoric, combined with rapid alternations of persona. Lesser examples are Goethe’s Mignon, Jane Austen’s Emma, and Tolstoy’s Natasha. Lady Caroline Lamb, Byron’s tempestuous mistress, will be our real-life example of the negative or afflicted Mercurius. At their most stagy and manipulative, Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord in The Philadelphia Story and Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind are the riveting Mercurius. Above all is Patrick Dennis’ breezy Auntie Mame, lavish practitioner of multiple personae, whose cult status among male homosexuals is the unmistakable sign of her cross-sexual character.

The princess had even pointed to a slight bulge between the horses’ eyes—the jibbah—the marker of the larger sinus capacity that allowed the Muniqi to thrive in the dry, unyielding deserts of this continent.

And from far away—a memory-that-was-not-a-memory stirred. Of summer nights spent in a forest glen, Maeve instructing her. Telling her a story about a queen who walked between worlds. Who had not been content in the realm in which she’d been born, and had found a way to leave it, using the lost knowledge of ancient wayfarers. World-walkers.

Northrop Frye speaks of “the self-enclosed world of the unproductive and narcissistic beautiful youth of Shakespeare’s sonnets, a ‘liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass’.”18 Frye is using an alchemical image from Sonnet 5, where summer flowers are distilled into an alembic of perfume, like love and beauty transformed into art. The beautiful boy of the sonnets is asocial, self-absorbed. Shakespeare exhorts him to marry and beget heirs lest his patrician line end (Sonnets 1–17). Ironically, as I see it, if the youth were to make the social commitment of marriage, he would immediately lose his glamourous narcissistic beauty, which is produced by his removal from time and community.

To love “is to be all made of fantasy.” The true lover is “unstaid and skittish in all motions” save the beloved’s image. The lover should wear “changeable taffeta,” for his mind is “a very opal” (AYLI V.ii.93; Twelfth II.iv.17–20, 73–75). Love dematerializes masculinity. Things are glimmering, wavering, liquefied. Art and love dissolve social habit and form, a Dionysian fluidity.

Shakespeare’s view of woman is revolutionary. Unlike Belphoebe or Britomart, Rosalind has a jovial inner landscape. It is not Spenser’s grim arena of virtue’s battle with vice. This landscape is airy and pleasant, full of charm and surprise. Rosalind’s self-pleasuring is not like Mona Lisa’s. No daemonic fog of solipsism hangs over her. Rosalind has an invigorating alertness. She is not smugly half-asleep, like Leonardo’s Renaissance woman. Mona Lisa still has the baleful Gorgon eye of archaic archetype. She burns us with her glance. The daemonic eye sees nothing but its prey. It seeks power, the fascism of nature. But Rosalind’s socialized eye moves to see. It takes things in. Hers are not the lustful rolling eyes of Spenser’s femmes fatales, which slither, pierce, and possess. Rosalind’s eye honors the integrity of objects and persons. Its mobility signals a mental processing of information, the visible sign of western intelligence. In Spenser, we saw, the virtuous eye is rigidly controlled. Until our century, a respectable woman kept her eyes modestly averted. Shakespeare legitimizes bold mobility of the female eye and identifies it with imagination. Rosalind’s eye is truly perceptive: it both sees and understands. Shakespeare’s great heroine unites multiplicity of gender, persona, word, eye, and thought. Despite his love for the glamourous personality of multiple moods and masks, Shakespeare subordinates all his characters to the public good.

To me, probably as time-bound as they, Cordelia seems a vapid nincompoop, self-righteous and self-thwarting. Even for her most generous apologists, Cleopatra presents interpretative problems. Her temperamental excesses make people uneasy. She is, in my terms, Shakespeare’s most uncontrolled and uncontrollable Dionysian androgyne, the metamorphosing Mercurius who obeys no law but her own. Hence she cannot survive her play.

Caesar’s patron is, to use Nietzche’s phrase, “Apollo, the founder of states.”25 Cleopatra’s world-view is promiscuously Dionysian: abolition of limits and boundaries, multiple personae, eating and drinking, sex, anarchic energy, natural fecundity. Caesar and his retinue call Antony effeminate, yet Antony is more masculine than Caesar in the usual sense. Caesar, a bland managerial type, is sexually neuter. He is an Apollonian androgyne. The dominant sexual persona of Spenser’s Faerie Queene has completely lost its glamour in Shakespeare’s Dionysian genre. In Antony and Cleopatra, Apollonianism is merely officiousness, the spite and banality of small minds.

Even before she absorbs Antony’s identity, Cleopatra is robustly half-masculine. Rivalled only by Rosalind, Cleopatra appropriates the powers and prerogatives of both sexes more lavishly than any other character in literature. Her sexual personae are energized by stormy infusions of Dionysian nature-force. Here Rosalind is more limited because more civilized. Cleopatra is psychically immersed in the irrational and barbaric. She is voluptuously female, a rarity in Shakespeare. Her sexuality is so potent in European terms that the Romans are always calling her whore, strumpet, trull. As the “serpent of old Nile,” she is the archetypal femme fatale (I.v.25). Cleopatra appears costumed as Isis, whom as queen she literally embodies. Her main distinction from the mocking Rosalind is her maternalism, which makes her cradle the asp like “my baby at my breast” (V.ii.309). The mother is one of Cleopatra’s many personae, but Rosalind and Spenser’s Britomart will become mothers only outside the frame of their works. This is because the archetype behind Rosalind is the chaste beautiful boy. Cleopatra is a virago, the androgynous type I found in Michelangelo’s Medici Chapel nudes, with their thrusting breasts. Rosalind inhabits the crisp Forest of Arden, the Northern European green world. But Cleopatra belongs to the heat-enervated Orient, whose oppressiveness hangs over Michelangelo’s women. Cleopatra is not more feminine than Rosalind, but she is far more female.

Cleopatra’s sadistic images are normal in Italian terms. My immigrant relatives used to say, “May you be killed!” or “May you be eaten by a cat!” Common Italian-American expressions, according to my father, took the form “Che te possono” (May such and such be done to you). For example, “May your eyes be torn out,” “May you drag your tongue along the ground,” “May they squeeze your testicles,” “May they sew up your anus.” The similarity to Cleopatra’s rhetorical style is obvious. Torture and homicide are immediately accessible to the Mediterranean imagination.

Did Shakespeare base Cleopatra on an Italian model? A. L. Rowse thinks the Dark Lady of the sonnets was the half-Italian Emilia Bassanio. Luigi Barzini describes “the importance of spectacle” in Italian culture, with its public staging of emotional scenes. He speaks of “the transparency of Italian faces,” which allows conversations to be followed at a distance: “Undisguised emotions, some sincere and some feigned, follow each other on an Italian’s face as swiftly as the shadows of clouds over a meadow on a windy day in spring.”

Shakespeare’s self-dramatizing Cleopatra has a fluid Italian expressiveness. In her amoral dissimulations, she confirms the negative Northern European view of Italian and papist character in the Renaissance. Renaissance England was more flamboyant than modern England but less so than Renaissance Italy. Hence in the spiritual geography of Antony and Cleopatra, Egypt is to Rome as Renaissance Italy was to Renaissance England.

But Shakespeare is well aware of the anarchic danger in a life of impersonations. Caesar wins in Antony and Cleopatra because he represents political order, the dream of the fractured, fractious Renaissance. Antony and Cleopatra’s reactionary political premise is borne out by Italian history, where theatrical individualism weakened centralized authority, aiding the rise of the tribal Mafia. Since World War II, nearly fifty governments have come and gone in Rome. Restless change is the rule.

Astrology, even more than alchemy, was one of the great symbol systems of the Renaissance. Its iconography pervaded Renaissance art, book illustration, and interior décor. The formidable combined forces of Judeo-Christianity and modern science have never succeeded in wiping out pagan astrology, nor will they ever. Astrology supplies what is missing in the west’s official moral and intellectual codes. Astrology is the oldest organized art form of sexual personae. Waging war on astrology, the medieval and Renaisssance Church promulgated the distortion that astrology is fatalism, a flouting of God’s Providence and the necessity for moral struggle.

The Greek word zodiac means circle of animals. Most birth signs are symbolized by animals, whose character astrology identifies with human types. Our behaviorist age is generally resistant to the idea of genetic traits, for individuals, sexes, or races. But ask any mother of a large family whether personality is innate or learned.

From long study, I summarize the astrological meaning of the elements as follows. Fire is will, originality, boldness, the amoral life force. Air is language, wit, balance, humane perspective. Water is intuition, sympathy, deep feeling, mystical oneness, and prophecy. Earth is order, method, precision, realism, materialism. Modern science discarded the four elements in favor of finer terminology.

John Anthony West claims, however, that the four principal elements of modern organic chemistry, hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, closely correspond in function to fire, earth, air, and water.29 Northrop Frye says, “Earth, air, water, and fire are still the four elements of imaginative experience, and always will be.”30 A person’s natal horoscope sometimes lacks one of the four elements, a disturbing imbalance which can and should be compensated for through self-analysis and vigilant effort.

Cleopatra as Venus is the power of physical attraction among the elements, which Empedocles attributes to Aphrodite. She is in heat: Shakespeare carefully adds fire to his tableau. That the barge “burns” is his addition to Plutarch’s description. Cleopatra is Venus born from the sea. In Enobarbus’ speech, she commands three elements: water, air, and fire. Earth is pointedly excluded. In fact, earth is evacuated, denuded of its properties by the rush of citizens shoreward.

Antony’s fateful decision to fight by sea ruins him. Commander of infantrymen and master of land warfare, he foolishly allows Cleopatra to dictate his battle plan. The Egyptians are seafarers. Cleopatra insists the ultimate contest with Caesar be by navy, not army. Antony’s seasoned soldiers passionately appeal to him, but blinded by love, he waves them away. In agreeing to fight by sea, Antony repudiates the element of earth, the foundation of his illustrious career.

Caesar’s deputy is an earth-spirit because Antony and Cleopatra identifies Caesar with the astrological qualities of earth—patience, pragmatism, emotional reserve, discipline, application. Caesar is the reality principle, Realpolitik. He represents what Antony and Cleopatra have rejected, and because drama must take place in human space and human time, he defeats them.

The Renaissance Shakespeare knows Antony and Cleopatra are morally in the wrong, yet he projects into them the liquefied proteanism of his own artistic self. Antony, once the “pillar” of the Roman world, sees himself turning into shifting clouds, shapes of horse, bear, lion, citadel, cliff, mountain (IV.xiv.2–14). Cleopatra has dissolved and naturalized him.

The symbolic marriage of Antony and Cleopatra, enacted at the moment of death, removes the lovers from the social order. Their hedonism and self-involvement have damaged their nations and their cause. Eight boars for breakfast is no recipe for political success. Cleopatra was the last of the Ptolemies, a three-hundred-year-old Macedonian dynasty. After her death, Egypt was annexed as subject state to Rome and never regained its former glory.

Antony and Cleopatra takes a double point of view: Shakespeare acknowledges the eternal authority of beauty and imagination, but he renders unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s. Social order and stability were primary English Renaissance values. This is why Rosalind, unlike Cleopatra, is the perfected Mercurius. At the end of her play, Rosalind demonstrates the subordination of personality to society by relinquishing her theatrical androgyny and metamorphoses for obedience in marriage. Hierarchy is restored, in home and palace.

No one fits the part—except Tina Turner, Kent Christensen’s superb suggestion to me.

John Donne is Shakespeare’s heir, muscular, theatrical, and metaphor-ridden. Donne fills even devout religious poems with flamboyant sexual personae and eccentric transpositions of gender. George Herbert is Spenser’s heir. The exquisite aestheticism of The Faerie Queene turns into feminine homoeroticism in Herbert. The silvery sweetness of Herbert’s simple style is exactly like Sappho’s. If you want to know how Sappho sounds in Greek, don’t read her pedestrian translators; read Herbert. Herbert discourages anything abrupt or emphatic—that is, masculine.

Turning from society toward nature, Rousseau creates the Romantic world-view. Though he allows authority to the state for public good, his most enduring bequest is the flamingly antiestablishment stance of radicals from Blake and Marx to the Rolling Stones. Rousseau makes freedom a western watchword. Like the Renaissance, the Enlightenment glamourized hierarchy, the great chain of being swept away by Romanticism. For Rousseau, the Swiss Protestant reformer, no hierarchy comes from nature. Politics can be reshaped by human will, for human benefit. Romanticism regards hierarchy as a repressive social fiction. But man is biologically a hierarchical animal. When one hierarchy is removed, another automatically springs up to take its place. The great irony of Romanticism is that a movement predicated on freedom will compulsively reenslave itself to imaginative orders even more fixed.

The ancient cult-followers of Dionysus knew that subordination to nature is a crucifixion and dismemberment. Human identity is obliterated in the Dionysian conversion of matter to energy, a theme of Euripides’ Bacchae. Romanticism, like the Rousseauist Swinging Sixties, misunderstands the Dionysian as the pleasure principle, when it is in fact the gross continuum of pleasure-pain.

The sexual revolution he wrought is evident in the emergence of homosexuality as a formal category. From antiquity, there were homosexual acts, honorable or dissolute depending on culture and time. Since the late nineteenth century, there is homosexuality, a condition of being entered after searching or “questioning,” a Rousseauist identity crisis. Modern psychology, following Rousseau, pessimistically roots sex deeper than does Judeo-Christianity, which subordinates sex to moral will. Our sexual “freedom” is a new enslavement to ancient Necessity

Rousseau’s philosophizing of sex originates in the failure of social and moral hierarchies in the late eighteenth century. Before the Enlightenment, rigid class stratification, however stultifying, provided a sense of community. Now identity, suddenly expanding, must find other means of definition. But sex is no substitute for metaphysics. Pascal says, “The tendency should be towards the general, and the bias towards self is the beginning of all disorder, in war, politics, economics, in man’s individual body.”

One cause of Rousseau’s simplistic nature-theory: there was no Faerie Queene in French literature to show the dangers of nature. Consequently, Sade arose, with all his horrors, to check Rousseau’s happy hopes. Rousseau and Sade together equal the totality of Spenser.

French intellectuals embraced him as a poet-criminal in the style of Jean Genet, homosexual thief and jailbird. But Sade has made barely a dent on American adacemic consciousness. It is his violence far more than his sex which is so hard for liberals to accept. For Sade, sex is violence. Violence is the authentic spirit of mother nature.

Sade’s daemonic mother nature is the bloodiest goddess since Asiatic Cybele. Rousseau revives the Great Mother, but Sade restores her true ferocity. She is Darwin’s nature, red in tooth and claw.

To prove human benevolence a utopian theory contradicted by reality, Sade assembles a catalog of atrocities committed by every culture in history, often in the name of religion. His anthropological syncretism, anticipating Frazer’s, demonstrates the relativism of sexual and criminal codes.

Virtue fails; vice prospers. I think that Justine is Rousseau and that Juliette is Sade. Virtue is “inert and passive,” but nature is “motion,” “active agitation.”12 In Sade as in Spenser, pure femininity is a vacuum into which nature’s energy violently rushes.

Sade’s scripts can be disarmingly mild: “Has a woman with beautiful hair brought to him, saying he simply wishes to examine her hair; but he cuts if off very traitorously and discharges upon seeing her melt into tears and bewail her misfortune, at which he laughs immoderately.”19 This is Spenserian masque, a public spectacle eroticized by juxtaposing feminine vulnerability with icy, lustful hierarchic power.

Mutilation of female genitals, reported to this day throughout the world, descends from ancient perceptions of the uncanniness of female fertility. Jung says, “Occasionally it still happens that the natives in the bush kill a woman and take out her uterus, in order to make use of this organ in magical rites.”22 Such things arise not from social prejudice but from legitimate fear of woman’s alliance with chthonian nature.

But before we condemn Sade, think of Tiepolo’s painting, The Martyrdom of Saint Agatha (1750). The saint ecstatically expires, eyes raised to heaven, while her bloody amputated breasts are collected for us by an insouciant pageboy hefting a silver platter. Are we expected to vomit or eat? For two thousand years, the torture of martyred saints, as well as of Christ, has filled western imagination with sadomasochistic reverie

De Beauvoir and Barthes connect Sade’s devaluation of the female body to his homosexual craving for sodomy.25 But sexual symbolism is greater than private habits. Sodomy is Sade’s rational protest against relentlessly overabundant procreative nature. Dog-style heterosexual copulation, a staple of current pornography, represents the animality and impersonality of sex-experience. When face is averted from face, emotion and society are annihilated. Remember the masked face of the Venus of Willendorf. The zippered leather mask of modern sadomasochistic gear covers the whole head and primitivizes the personality.

Like Blake, Sade brings the Great Mother into being as an act of hostility. The campaign against Madame de Mistival begins with Dolmancé’s proclamation, “We owe absolutely nothing to our mothers.” After Harold Bloom’s study of male poetic strife in The Anxiety of Influence, it is impossible to read such a statement without hearing its real meaning: “We owe absolutely everything to our mothers.”

Like the Roman emperors, he juxtaposes artificiality and sophistication with chthonian barbarism. His libertines are “indifferent to everything simple and commonplace,” a Decadent phrase.28 The libertines are always self-immured, a Decadent claustrophobia. We will find a parallel in the imprisoned spaces of the Gothic novel, which reach the Decadence through Poe. Sade’s corpse-strewn sexual arenas resemble the Gothic morgue. These heaps of rotting matter are the accumulated objects of nature and society which I see oppressing Romantic imagination.

This was the first salvo of Romantic youth-cult, to return in our own frenetic 1960s. I attribute these suicides to the shift in sexual personae at the close of the eighteenth century. Theodore Faithfull says in another context, “Dreams of self-destruction, and probably many cases of suicide, are desires or attempts on the part of narcissistic individuals to give themselves a new birth by sexually attacking themselves and thus bringing about self fertilization.”

Mignon’s early death is foreshadowed in her unnatural excitation. When Wilhelm meets her, she “darted like lightning through the door”: “She never walked up or down the stairs, but jumped. She would spring along by the railing, and before you were aware, would be sitting quietly above upon the landing.” She dances “lightly, nimbly, quickly.” Mignon sounds like Shakespeare’s antic Ariel, but there is something disturbingly pathological in her energy. She has palpitations and fits, a worsening “spasmodic vivacity” or “restless stillness.” She constantly twists or chews thread, napkins, paper, as if to drain “some inward violent commotion.”

Sometimes appearing in pageboy or other male dress, Lady Caroline was notorious for her mad nervous energy and exhibitionistic pranks. She smashed china in her rages; she was publicly self-destructive, as when, jealous of Byron, she shattered a wineglass in her hands.

One of the Venetian Epigrams suppressed because of their frank sexual content is about Bettina: “What worries me most is that Bettina grows always more skillful, / Always more supple becomes every joint in her frame; / At last she’ll bring her little tongue into her dainty slit; / She’ll play with her charming self, lose all interest in men”

A sister is a woman who is not the mother. Goethe would not allow his mother’s name to be spoken in his presence. He avoided her. He refused to answer questions about the episode of the Mothers. Goethe’s mother was too strong a personality. He feared to come near her lest he be reabsorbed into her gravitational field and returned to childhood dependency.

Kleist’s Achilles, unlike Homer’s, wants to lose. Three times he casts away sword and shield. He walks to his death in somnambulistic trance, seeking enslavement to Penthesilea, who falls upon him with her dogs. The play suddenly ascribes a feminine softness to Achilles. As he turns his neck, it is pierced by Penthesilea’s arrow. Neck-turning or neck-exposing is a classically feminine gesture, with parallels of animal surrender.

Kleist dwells on the Amazons’ amputated breasts throughout the play. Greek artists, we saw, never showed the Amazon’s body as maimed. The Late Romantic Kleist, on the other hand, makes the detail central. Nowhere else in literature or art, not even in Sade, is so much made of breast amputation.

The dissolution of hierarchical orders permitted personality to expand so suddenly that it went into a free fall of anxiety. Hence the self had to be chastened, its boundaries redefined, even by pain. The self must be reduced in size. This is the ultimate meaning of Penthesilea’s erotics of mastectomy.

Protestant rationalism is defeated by Gothic’s return to the ritualism and mysticism of medieval Catholicism, with its residual paganism. Art withdraws into caverns, castles, prison-cells, tombs, coffins. Gothic is a style of claustrophobic sensuality. Its closed spaces are daemonic wombs. The Gothic novel is sexually archaic: it withdraws into chthonian darkness, the realm of Goethe’s Mothers. Mother night pervades Romanticism, from Coleridge and Keats to Poe and Chopin with his brooding nocturnes.

Successful mastery of this matter leads to development of inborn powers and flourishing of organism, which allows it to master more matter, to marshal the lower to feed the higher. It is mobilization of matter to develop the inborn character or idea or fate—this true not only for food literally. In social animals an analogous process takes place within social relations or social “space”: there are some important changes that happen here, but principle is same. Important to understand that there is a circular process: organism seeks mastery of space, environment, to master matter in ways particular to its own abilities, and as a result of this mastery of matter there is development of its body, its senses, and all of its faculties, and the unfolding of its inborn destined form or nature, in time, its particular form flowering in the spring of its season. All of this requires precisely freedom from struggle for survival, or time away from this, a reprieve from this pressure.

Very far from its aims: it seeks to become strong, skillful, to master problems and feel the expansion of its powers, and not just feel them, but perceive it to be truly so, perceive intuitively its mastery over its space. Only after full development of its powers and its mastery over space specific to its needs does the need or desire for reproduction come.

These peoples saw the vigor of youth as the true driving force behind life and behind all things, forever renewing itself, reincarnating itself anew in each generation in full force, though the memories of men and of societies may disappear. If you want the most beautiful poetic expression of this view, you must see in the Iliad when Homer describes the death of Euphorbus. His death is compared to young tree in its prime blown down by strong wind. Pythagoras, looking on Euphorbus’ shield in Sicily, broke into tears, remembering that he had been this man. He knew of what was hidden on the other side of the shield. This view persists: and this is why someone like D.H. Lawrence could look on the sarcophagi of the ancient Tuscans and see in this pleasure- and beauty-loving people a celebration of something very similar. They put on their funerary objects images of reveling, and feasting, and abundant flourishing life and great joy, wine parties, leaping dolphins, to remind themselves that this irrepressible force, nature, youth continues anew in each generation and is never defeated by death.

Camille Paglia says that the modern homosexual is the product of the pressures of post-industrial life. Her model for this is that a very sensitive young boy, open to aesthetic experience of all kinds, maybe the kind of slightly neurotic and artistic boy that a century ago would have experienced synaesthesia; such boy is turned off by the horseplay and “rough” masculinity of his brothers and father and other boys his age. The distancing from this masculinity is concurrent with his becoming over-close with his mother, idolizing the feminine: upon puberty, the distance or fear from masculinity leads him to eroticize it, while he turns away from women, either because of too much familiarity, or too much awe. In this she is only half right, and the other half of the story I discovered from an alien mind whose teachings have been spread among some of the frogs.

Now, Paglia’s restatement of Freud is correct, but she misses an important element of the story, which is why such a boy turns away from the masculinity of his peers in the first place. It is not horseplay or the roughness of male competition as such that makes him turn away, but the utterly fake or artificial character of such displays, usually, in our time. Such boy perceives what his peers don’t, the conditional and entirely dependent character of life in our age. It is not the masculinity, the competition for status among men, the physical roughness, that makes him turn away… but the fact that all such play is happening in already owned space.

that when, late in adolescence or some time in youth, such boy decides he is “gay,” that is but the final act of self-misunderstanding. The drama of his spirit is reinterpreted on sexual terms. He has convinced himself that the feeling of suppression and dread that had accompanied him his whole life was because his sexual desires or “sexuality” had been repressed by “society.” He forgets how these sexual desires developed in the first place, that these desires themselves were a circuitous result of the truth that dawned on him in silence, the truth of the utter subjection and domestication of the space in which he found himself. In becoming “gay” he believes he is escaping that sense of primal limitation and subjection that he felt as a small boy: he has reinterpreted his entire drama as a maudlin story of sexuality suppressed or oppressed by retrograde social and political norms. In this he becomes an unwitting pawn himself of the very power that as a young boy he had intuited to be the enemy, the great and suffocating shadow of our time, that smothers all higher life out. The gay is the spiritual foot-soldier of the new regime, when he is born to be its enemy.

Blake was contemptuous of “Mercy, Pity, Peace.” “Infant Joy” is a parodistic critique of Rousseauism.

Like Sade, Blake sees chastity as unnatural, energy-killing. But in urging Thel, a sick rose, to cure herself by surrendering to communion, Blake is closer to Shakespeare of the comedies, where all are given in marriage, than he is to his fellow Romantic poets, for whom solitude is imaginative perfection. Shakespeare, subordinating sex to society, makes a Renaissance escape from the problem confronting Blake. Trying to eliminate society but redeem sex, Blake keeps finding himself in Leonardo’s rockscape. Every inch he saves for sex is lost in the desolate mile of mother nature.

One of Blake’s remarks about whores: “In a wife I would desire / What in whores is always found / The lineaments of Gratified desire.” Stone tablets, stony face. Blake thinks religious repression of sex makes misery and hypocrisy. Lower-class whores, then and now, sop up the male run-off from “decent” middle-class marriage. Men chase by night those they will not greet by day.

The Mental Traveller is a cycle of sexual cannibalism enacted by a male and a female figure, who attack and retreat in obsessive rhythms of victory and defeat. A boy babe is given to “a Woman Old,” who nails him down upon a rock, binds iron thorns around his head, pierces his hands and feet, and cuts his heart out “to make it feel both cold & heat.” “Her fingers number every Nerve.” She lives on his “shrieks & cries” and “grows young as he grows old.” Now the cycle reverses: “he rends up his Manacles / And binds her down for his delight.” The poem moves by systaltic throbbing of the heart.

The Mental Traveller has a choreographic ritualism. It’s like a parody of ballroom dancing where the lady keeps trying to lead. At the end, we are sent back to the start of the poem to read it again—a trope Joyce adopts for Finnegans Wake. The Mental Traveller is a uroboros mimicking the circularity of natural process. Each sex devours the other.

Female genitalia are not beautiful by any aesthetic standard. In fact, as I argued earlier, the idea of beauty is a defensive swerve from the ugliness of sex and nature. Female genitals are literally grotesque. That is, they are of the grotto, earth fissures leading to the chthonian cavern of the womb.

The male, thrusting into the cabinet’s sexual center, sees where he came from and is horrified. I reject criticism’s tidy assessment of Blake’s sex theory, where redeemed imagination opposes and reconciles civilization and nature. Poetry is written and read with emotion, not mind.

My generation has seen the workings of sexual freedom not in an imagined future but a chaotic present. Hence I value Blake not as a prophet of sexual liberation but as a magus who has studied the secrets of nature and seen the outrageous enslavements of our life in the body. The Mental Traveller and “The Crystal Cabinet” dramatize the limitations of sex. There is no sex without yielding to nature. And nature is a female domain.

In Blake, however, there is no up or down. Tracks of emotional force are not rectangular but spiral: Mannerist images of the “Vortex” recur. The Spectre veers off at an eccentric angle from the self. Blake’s fluid world is full of disjunctions of scale, gross expansions and stifling diminutions. It has the spongy relativism of modern physics.

In Blake the soul has split, so that the prophetic poems ask what is the “true” self. This is a new question in history, more sweeping than the multiple impersonations of the Renaissance, where social order was still a moral value. In Blake, territorial war is waged among parts of the self. His characters are in identity crisis, Rousseau’s invention. In his Spectres and Emanations, Blake is doing allegorically what the nineteenth-century novel will do naturalistically, documenting the modulations of emotion. Blake rejects Judeo-Christian morality. Nevertheless, he wants to integrate sexuality with right action. But sex, which Christianity correctly assigns to the daemonic realm, always escapes moral control.

Blake blames Venetian and Flemish painting for “losing the outlines.” There must be “firm and determinate outline”: “The great and golden rule of art, as well as of life, is this: That the more distinct, sharp, and wirey the bounding line, the more perfect the work of art; and the less keen and sharp, the greater is the evidence of weak imitation, plagiarism, and bungling…. How do we distinguish the oak from the beech, the horse from the ox, but by the bounding outline? How do we distinguish one face or countenance from another, but by the bounding line and its infinite inflexions and movements?”

A man can walk vigorously free on the earth, exposing his genitals without self-consciousness or guilt. But a woman’s genitals are not visible when she stands or walks. To expose herself, she must lie on her back or squat over the observer’s face! In other words, she must take a position of submission or dominance, as in a primitive statuette or cult act. Man is either gynecologist or supine asphyxiate. The female body can never be made completely visible; it will always be a dark, secret place.

Art is born of stress, not repose. Art is always a swerve from primary experience. Blake’s long poems are full of knots, breaches, and strains. They are held together by force of will, like an ancient monument (the Porch of the Maidens) sutured by iron rods. Blake’s lack of complete intelligibility comes from his philosophical discontinuities. His hopeless but heroic task, to redeem sex from nature, is a western epic saga.

Blake desires free imagination, but he exalts eroticism and makes chastity a perversion. This is impossible. There can be no active sexuality without surrender to nature and to liquidity, the realm of the mother. Blake wants nature bound but sex unbound.

In A Room of One’s Own, Virginia Woolf satirically describes her perplexity at the bulging card catalog of the British Museum: why, she asks, are there so many books written by men about women but none by women about men? The answer to her question is that from the beginning of time men have been struggling with the threat of woman’s dominance. The flood of books was prompted not by woman’s weakness but by her strength, her complexity and impenetrability, her dreadful omnipresence. No man has yet been born, even Jesus himself, who was not spun from a pitiful speck of plasma to a conscious being on the secret loom within a woman’s body. That body is the cradle and soft pillow of woman’s love, but it is also the torture rack of nature.

These irreconcilable contradictions arise from Blake’s violent yoking together of two opposing systems, the Bible and the visual arts. As a graphic artist, Blake is already beyond Old Testament Judaism, which condemns image-making as idolatry. The Ten Commandments forbid pictures of all kinds—of animals, fish, or gods. This is a Hebrew strategy against pagan fertility cults, which saw divinity in nature. Yahweh’s injunction diverted Jewish creative energy away from the visual arts into theology, philosophy, literature, law, and science, by which the Jews have made a stunning impact on world culture, far outweighing their small numbers. Blake’s eccentric psychology comes from the fact that he is a strange combination of artist and Hebrew prophet.

“Every problem you were given,” the Dean went on, “every project you had to design—what did you do with it? Every one of them done in that—well, I cannot call it a style—in that incredible manner of yours. It is contrary to every principle we have tried to teach you, contrary to all established precedents and traditions of Art. You may think you are what is called a modernist, but it isn’t even that.

Henry Cameron was hard to get in those days. He had a waiting list two years in advance; he designed personally every structure that left his office. He chose what he wished to build. When he built, a client kept his mouth shut. He demanded of all people the one thing he had never granted anybody: obedience. He went through the years of his fame like a projectile flying to a goal no one could guess. People called him crazy. But they took what he gave them, whether they understood it or not, because it was a building “by Henry Cameron.”

Heyer. Most of the press helped the fight along, urging the contractors not to surrender. The loudest attacks against the strikers came from the powerful papers of the great Wynand chain. “We have always stood,” said the Wynand editorials, “for the rights of the common man against the yellow sharks of privilege, but we cannot give our support to the destruction of law and order.” It had never been discovered whether the Wynand papers led the public or the public led the Wynand papers; it was known only that the two kept remarkably in step. It was not known to anyone, however, save to Guy Francon and a very few others, that Gail Wynand owned the corporation which owned the corporation which owned the Noyes-Belmont Hotel.

For Ashley was born of a line of men who used their leisure for thinking, not doing, for spinning brightly colored dreams that had in them no touch of reality. He moved in an inner world that was more beautiful than Georgia and came back to reality with reluctance. He looked on people, and he neither liked nor disliked them. He looked on life and was neither heartened nor saddened. He accepted the universe and his place in it for what they were and, shrugging, turned to his music and books and his better world.

In fact, the mothers of all her girl friends impressed on their daughters the necessity of being helpless, clinging, doe-eyed creatures. Really, it took a lot of sense to cultivate and hold such a pose. Perhaps she had been too brash. Occasionally she had argued with Ashley and frankly aired her opinions. Perhaps this and her healthy enjoyment of walking and riding had turned him from her to the frail Melanie. Perhaps if she changed her tactics—But she felt that if Ashley succumbed to premeditated feminine tricks, she could never respect him as she now did.

Most of the young ladies were seated with partners on the long benches that faced the tables, but Scarlett, realizing that a girl has only two sides and only one man can sit on each of these sides, had elected to sit apart so she could gather about her as many men as possible.

"Mr. Hamilton, I am not unaware of the honor you have bestowed on me in wanting me to become your wife, but this is all so sudden that I do not know what to say." That was a neat way of smoothing a man's vanity and yet keeping him on the string, and Charles rose to it as though such bait were new and he the first to swallow it.

Through the wide bay window on the lawn she could see the men still lounging in their chairs under the trees and in the shade of the arbor. How she envied them! How wonderful to be a man and never have to undergo miseries such as she had just passed through. As she stood watching them, hot eyed and dizzy, she heard the rapid pounding of a horse's hooves on the front drive, the scattering of gravel and the sound of an excited voice calling a question to one of the negroes. The gravel flew again and across her vision a man on horseback galloped over the green lawn toward the lazy group under the trees.

What Melanie did was no more than all Southern girls were taught to do—to make those about them feel at ease and pleased with themselves. It was this happy feminine conspiracy which made Southern society so pleasant. Women knew that a land where men were contented, uncontradicted and safe in possession of unpunctured vanity was likely to be a very pleasant place for women to live. So, from the cradle to the grave, women strove to make men pleased with themselves, and the satisfied men repaid lavishly with gallantry and adoration. In fact, men willingly gave the ladies everything in the world except credit for having intelligence. Scarlett exercised the same charms as Melanie but with a studied artistry and consummate skill. The difference between the two girls lay in the fact that Melanie spoke kind and flattering words from a desire to make people happy, if only temporarily, and Scarlett never did it except to further her own aims.

They loved their men, they believed in them, they trusted them to the last breaths of their bodies. How could disaster ever come to women such as they when their stalwart gray line stood between them and the Yankees? Had there ever been such men as these since the first dawn of the world, so heroic, so reckless, so gallant, so tender? How could anything but overwhelming victory come to a Cause as just and right as theirs? A Cause they loved as much as they loved their men, a Cause they served with their hands and their hearts, a Cause they talked about, thought about, dreamed about—a Cause to which they would sacrifice these men if need be, and bear their loss as proudly as the men bore their battle flags.

He not only brought Maybelle the satin but he was able to give excellent hints on the making of the wedding dress. Hoops in Paris were wider this season and skirts were shorter. They were no longer ruffled but were gathered up in scalloped festoons, showing braided petticoats beneath. He said, too, that he had seen no pantalets on the streets, so he imagined they were "out." Afterwards, Mrs. Merriwether told Mrs. Elsing she feared that if she had given him any encouragement at all, he would have told her exactly what kind of drawers were being worn by Parisiennes. Had he been less obviously masculine, his ability to recall details of dresses, bonnets and coiffures would have been put down as the rankest effeminacy.

He not only affronted the town with insinuations of venality on the part of men in high places and slurs on the courage of the men in the field, but he took pleasure in tricking the dignified citizenry into embarrassing situations. He could no more resist pricking the conceits, the hypocrisies and the flamboyant patriotism of those about him than a small boy can resist putting a pin into a balloon. He neatly deflated the pompous and exposed the ignorant and the bigoted, and he did it in such subtle ways, drawing his victims out by his seemingly courteous interest, that they never were quite certain what had happened until they stood exposed as windy, high flown and slightly ridiculous.

But, no matter what rallying cries the orators give to the idiots who fight, no matter what noble purposes they assign to wars, there is never but one reason for a war. And that is money. All wars are in reality money squabbles. But so few people ever realize it. Their ears are too full of bugles and drums and the fine words from stay-at-home orators. Sometimes the rallying cry is 'Save the Tomb of Christ from the Heathen!' Sometimes it's 'Down with Popery!' and sometimes 'Liberty!' and sometimes 'Cotton, Slavery and States' Rights!' "

Scarlett's guilty conscience stirred as she tried to recall what Ashley might have written that would lead Melanie to make such a statement, but most of the letters she had read had gone out of her head as soon as she finished reading them. She believed Melanie had simply taken leave of her senses. "Ashley wrote me that we should not be fighting the Yankees. And that we have been betrayed into it by statesmen and orators mouthing catchwords and prejudices," said Melly rapidly. "He said nothing in the world was worth what this war was going to do to us. He said here wasn't anything at all to glory—it was just misery and dirt."

Scarlett said nothing. She did not even squeeze the hand that Melanie had inserted into her palm for comfort. She had read Ashley's letters for only one purpose—to assure herself that he still loved her. Now Melanie had given a new meaning to passages in the letters which Scarlett's eyes had barely seen. It shocked her to realize that anyone as absolutely perfect as Ashley could have any thought in common with such a reprobate as Rhett Butler. She thought: "They both see the truth of this war, but Ashley is willing to die about it and Rhett isn't. I think that shows Rhett's good sense." She paused a moment, horror struck that she could have such a thought about Ashley. "They both see the same unpleasant truth, but Rhett likes to look it in the face and enrage people by talking about it—and Ashley can hardly bear to face it" It was very bewildering.

"No, I don't," said Melanie. "And I won't be rude to him, either. I think people are acting like chickens with their heads off about Captain Butler. I'm sure he can't be all the bad things Dr. Meade and Mrs. Merriwether say he is. He wouldn't hold food from starving people. Why, he even gave me a hundred dollars for the orphans. I'm sure he's just as loyal and patriotic as any of us and he's just too proud to defend himself. You know how obstinate men are when they get their backs up." Aunt Pitty knew nothing about men, either with their backs up or otherwise, and she could only wave her fat little hands helplessly.

Let the English mill workers starve because they can't get our cotton but never, never strike a blow for slavery. And as for France, that weak imitation of Napoleon is far too busy establishing the French in Mexico to be bothered with us. In fact he welcomes this war, because it keeps us too busy to run his troops out of Mexico... No, Scarlett, the idea of assistance from abroad is just a newspaper invention to keep up the morale of the South. The Confederacy is doomed. It's living on its hump now, like the camel, and even the largest of humps aren't inexhaustible. I give myself about six months more of blockading and then I'm through.

Why, Scarlett, the Yankees are buying soldiers from Europe by the thousands! Most of the prisoners we've taken recently can't even speak English. They're Germans and Poles and wild Irishmen who talk Gaelic. But when we lose a man, he can't be replaced.

When Scarlett was seeing Rhett to the door, she asked indignantly: "If it were you, wouldn't you enlist with the Yankees to keep from dying in that place and then desert?" "Of course," said Rhett, his teeth showing beneath his mustache. "Then why didn't Ashley do it?" "He's a gentleman," said Rhett, and Scarlett wondered how it was possible to convey such cynicism and contempt in that one honorable word.

There were hundreds of men skulking in the swamps and the mountains, defying the provost guard to drag them back to the army. They were the ones who declared it was a "rich man's war and a poor man's fight"

When will it be over? When will you come home? We are hungry, hungry." When furloughs from the rapidly thinning army were denied, these soldiers went home without them, to plow their land and plant their crops, repair their houses and build up their fences. When regimental officers, understanding the situation, saw a hard fight ahead, they wrote these men, telling them to rejoin their companies and no questions would be asked. Usually the men returned when they saw that hunger at home would be held at bay for a few months longer. "Plow furloughs" were not looked upon in the same light as desertion in the face of the enemy, but they weakened the army just the same.

All your beaux have respected you too much, though God knows why, or they have been too afraid of you to really do right by you. The result is that you are unendurably uppity. You should be kissed and by someone who knows how."

Billy knew that any emphasis on ass and tits played bloody hell with elegance. The absolute chic of her clothes was at war with her innate sensuality. She put people off-balance, almost certainly on purpose, because she wore her offhand yet splendid garments as if she was equally prepared to tear them off and tumble into bed, or to stand in front of a photographer and pose for Women’s Wear Daily.

La Comtesse Lilianne de Vertdulac had lost everything in World War II except her sense of form, her courage, her style, and her kindness. Her style was a mixture of innate taste stripped down to its simplest expression and a personal evasiveness, a quality of holding herself back, eluding intimacy, which gave her that fascination that forthcoming people never inspire.

Billy had not loved herself for many years, and for as many years, hope had been slowly extinguished in her.

She ate to avoid thinking about herself and why she was not loved. Now, with great shyness at first, and then with more and more freedom, she became her own love object. Soon she loved herself enough to welcome hunger and discover that, for her, it was a necessary feeling. Within weeks she developed an obsessive terror of ever leaving the table feeling comfortably full, a feeling that would last all her life.

She was thin and she was beautiful, Billy told herself fiercely. Those were the important things. The necessary things. The rest she would have to get for herself. She had no intention of dying for love of a man, like one of the nineteenth-century women in the books she had read. She was no Emma Bovary, no Anna Karenina, no Camille—no spineless, adoring, passive creature who would let a man take away her reason for living by taking away his love. The next time she loved, she promised herself, it would be on her terms.

It was a period during which women, lunching together at the Relais Plaza of the Plaza Athenée Hôtel, the most elegant “snack bar” in Paris, invariably devoted the first hour of their meal to deciding which of the other women in the room were wearing “une vraie” and which were wearing “une fausse” Chanel. Clever copyists were able to reproduce everything, even to the gold chain that weighed down the bottom of the jacket lining and made it hang perfectly, but something always gave une fausse away: a slightly less than authentic button, fringe on the pockets that was two millimeters too long or one millimeter too short, the right fabric in the wrong color.

Valentine learned to anticipate within seconds the moment at which a woman would try to blame the house of Balmain for the fact that she could not wear a garment with the same allure as could a mannequin who was four inches taller and weighed sixty pounds less than she. She also absorbed the techniques used to deal with this frequent occurrence, techniques developed over lifetimes of selling by the hardened, canny, cynical chief vendeuses. From the women who were fitted, often in pain from the discomfort of standing absolutely still for hours at a time in their beautiful, handmade, high-heeled shoes, she learned the power of vanity and the stubbornness of the determination to possess exactly the right dress, no matter what agony was involved. She learned more about women, especially rich women, than any girl her age should know.

Chic is in the way a woman wears her clothes, not the clothes themselves. Elegance is in the line and quality of the clothes and the line of the body under them and in the wearer’s personal intensity about the importance of perfect details. Glamour, a word that is so impossible to pin down that it doesn’t exist in any language except English, is a combination of sophistication, mystery, magic, and movies. Chien is spicy, tart, amusing, pungent, tempting, and puts the male world on notice that this is no ordinary woman. Chic and elegance have nothing to do with sexiness, glamour has much to do with sexiness, chien has everything to do with sexiness. Catherine Deneuve has glamour, but Cher has chien. Jacqueline Bisset and Jacqueline Onassis both have glamour, but Susan Blakely, Brenda Vaccaro, Sara Miles, and Barbra Streisand all have chien. So did Becky Sharp and Scarlett O’Hara and so did Valentine O’Neill, both in her person and in her work.

“But you’re very mysterious to me. I’m only talking about some of the obvious things I see—it’s in my profession to see these things, as if you were a character in a script. In the treatment for the script—the outline—we write something like ‘Billy Ikehorn is a beautiful, rich young widow who does not have a fixed center to her life, so she goes to the Cannes Film Festival with a friend, hoping for some distraction’ and then we have established the character and we can go on from there. But that doesn’t mean we know the really important things about her, the motivations, the nuances. Some will come out in the script and some in the actress we pick to play Billy Ikehorn—she must bring her own quality to the part. And the audience supplies the rest—each one of them brings something different to the idea of ‘rich young widow.’ So you remain mysterious still.”

Now women can ask for what they want and get it.” “Not from me, my darling, not unless I want to give it.” “You’re holding back progress.” Billy felt suddenly shrill, false. She’d never given a thought to the liberation of women, and now she sounded as if she’d been a dues-paying feminist for years. But better to sound absurd than rejected, better to make a bad joke than to admit how she yearned for him to love her, to marry her, like one of those silly besotted nineteenth-century literary heroines she had always sworn she would never be like, long, long ago.

Poor Billy, she thought, dissatisfied already, and yet how can anyone tell you the truth about what goes on in the heart of any marriage that endures? Who can teach you about the times when the well of love seems to run almost dry and you just have to keep going on faith, the moments when both of you wonder what wonderful other thing might have happened if you hadn’t met each other? Who can really explain about learning to communicate your true feelings to each other in spite of the traps of words and gestures—the days, even months, when communication somehow fails?

For about five years all my conversations with women were about diets; they always zeroed in on the pivotal reality of their life, which was that they were imperfect. Not like George Harrison. But with me, especially, I was doomed to have this flesh all over me, unless I ate only vegetables and fish and drank only Perrier water, I practiced my yoga faithfully, I never forgot to drink apple cider vinegar and take kelp pills; if I did all of that—why then, there I’d be in a room and you wouldn’t be able to tell me apart from all the other women who were clawing with their fingernails to maintain the same size.

He was in some dim borderline country where time was standing still and Ellen was always in the next room.

Shelley enjoyed subordination to female power. He told Elizabeth Hitchener, “You are as my better genius.” A letter to his future wife declares: “Your thoughts alone can waken mine to energy. … My understanding becomes undisciplined without you.” This persona of ritual dependency is a characteristic Romantic mask. John Stuart Mill similarly idolized Harriet Taylor, whom he calls a genius and his intellectual superior, source of those achievements for which the world mistakenly honors him alone. Gertrude Himmelfarb, among others, shows this to be a patent falsification.8 However, Mill’s imagining Harriet as superior may genuinely have energized him.

The poet’s summons to Emilia is usually dismissed as a sentimental elopement fantasy. But Emilia will be “a bride” to the poet’s spirit and “a vestal sister” to his body. Vestal means virgin: this is a no-sex marriage. Shelley imagines their voyage to an idyllic Greek island with fountains and streams “as clear as elemental diamond,” under “the roof of blue Ionian weather.” I suspect the wording and décor influenced Baudelaire’s gorgeous “Invitation to the Voyage,” with its dreamy appeal to the Romantic sister-spirit.

Epipsychidion and the Vita Nuova are classic texts of western erotic perversity, which gives enormous hierarchic stature to self-enclosed Apollonian personality, a living objet d’art. I think the exclamatory style of Epipsychidion partly comes from the aggressive force needed to break into the near-autistic consciousness of this kind of glamourous androgyne, with his or her dreamy apartness.

Shelley’s revulsion from Emilia Viviani was an aesthetic swerve. It happened like this: Emilia’s seraphically transparent flesh suddenly appeared heavy and coarsely female. I have seen with my own eyes the humiliating changes life works on the personality of high glamour. The luminous complexion turns muddy; the aura vanishes. Glamour is a gift under no one’s control. In women it may peak and ebb with the menstrual cycle. A Shelleyan declension from idealization to disillusion occurs in D. H. Lawrence’s The Rainbow, in Ursula’s infatuation with her teacher, Winifred Inger. It begins in Apollonian radiance and Greek archetype and ends, like Epipsychidion, in a sad fall into earthliness.

“Firm-bodied as Diana,” dressed in a tunic “like a Greek girl’s,” Inger is “proud and free as a man, yet exquisite as a woman.” Ursula thinks: “Ah, the beauty of the firm, white, cool flesh! Ah, the wonderful firm limbs. … The whole body was defined, firm and magnificent.” But after the two become intimate, Ursula experiences the Shelleyan revulsion. She feels “a sort of nausea,” “a heavy, clogged sense of deadness.” Inger is “ugly, clayey”: “Her female hips seemed big and earthy.”13 Ursula is evolving from lesbianism to heterosexuality, continued in the sequel, Women in Love. Ursula’s vision of her teacher is like Shelley’s of Emilia Viviani. The Apollonian androgyne of radiant Greek beauty degenerates into matter without contour. The poet moved on and left the shell of his vision behind.

The nervous, impressionable poet has a feminine sensitivity. He is a stranger exiled among virile men. The price for the Romantic poet’s appropriation of female powers is mutilation, which Erich Neumann calls “the condition of all creation.”

The problem of evil had an assigned place in all-inclusive Christian theology. But as religion weakened, evil sprang free. The evil of chthonian nature is far less rational and explicable than the evil of an envious master demon. Romantic imagination faced evil without the organized certitudes of church and state.

Hence the nineteenth-century abundance of daemonic epiphanies of the double. The self ambushes, harasses, flails itself. Romanticism’s most terrifying encounter with the double was ironically by the atheist Shelley. Making himself feminine, the poet was under the fascist rod of what he had repressed.

Keats, Shelley’s slain Adonis, supplements and corrects Wordsworth. Keats’s nature welcomes rather than abandons, because he restores to it the sensuality and eroticism that Wordsworth removed. But Keats, as much as Wordsworth, cannot bear the daemonism Coleridge sees in sex and nature. Reviving the femmes fatales of The Faerie Queene, Keats revises the unpalatable facts of female power. His poetry is a Eumenides, a renaming and palliation. Keats turns every Fury into a “Kindly One.” His clear, simple style is as much a defense mechanism as Blake’s in the stormy, opaque prophetic books. Keats’s sexual anxiety, suppressed in the poems, is perfectly apparent in his letters.

I adapt from the letter on the chameleon poet: woman’s overfull identity “begins to press upon” Keats, so that he is “in a very little time annihilated.” My theory seems confirmed by Keats’s complaint to Fanny Brawne: “You have absorb’d me.” Keats flees the company of women to escape being swallowed up by them.

Balzac’s Zambinella is the first Decadent art object. The transsexual castrato is an artificial sex, product of biology manipulated for art. Zambinella does give birth—to other art objects. First is Sarrasine’s statue of him/her; then a marble copy commissioned by the cardinal; next a painting of Adonis based on the copy; finally, Girodet’s sensuous painting of effeminate sleeping Endymion, inspired, Balzac claims, by Zambinella as Adonis. The sterile castrato, propagating itself through other art works, is an example of my technological androgyne, the manufactured object. Like Vergil’s Trojan Horse, he/she teems with inorganic seed.

Like Coleridge’s poet, Zambinella is privileged but cursed. Her castration is the shamanistic sacrifice of virility accompanying a special gift in antiquity. Showered with acclaim, she suffers harsh removal from normal life. She hates humanity: “For me, the world is a desert. I am an accursed creature.” The androgyne’s lonely isolation looks backward toward Fragoletta and forward toward Baudelaire’s “Delphine and Hippolyte,” which borrows Balzac’s words.

Zambinella inhabits an uncanny temenos, a sequestered zone created by her hieratic power. When Sarrasine first sees her, she is protected by the theatrical frame, through which no one can step. Visiting her mansion, he is led through a moonlit “labyrinth” of halls and stairs to the innermost sanctum, a sumptuous “mysterious room.” Zambinella is kept, in effect, in a seraglio, a motif Balzac reuses in The Girl with the Golden Eyes. The physical and psychological imprisonment is Decadent. Sarrasine’s pitiless hierarch, the shadowy cardinal, keeps Zambinella in bondage.

“Have you any sisters who resemble you? Then die!” This is not the Renaissance, where a lucky twin steps forward to deflect homoerotic impulses into marriage. Sarrasine’s sexual error ends in his death. He is a Decadent victim to art, a new religion craving martyrs. What is modern about Sarrasine is its central question of sexual identity, Rousseau’s invention. Balzac shows sexuality as something incomprehensible and deranging.

Glamour and charisma are hermaphroditic principles. Balzac captures the decadence inherent in the Catholic castrati. Heriot calls ecclesiastic policy “absurdly inconsistent”: even accomplices in the act of castration could be excommunicated, yet every Italian church had castrato singers, even the Vatican. St. Paul’s injunction that women keep silent in church kept them out of choirs until the seventeenth century and later. Hence high parts were taken by boys or eunuchs.

The horror of the two scenes comes from the mutilation of a sensuous female body around which an erotic aura has been painstakingly built up, in Balzac by the stressing of Paquita’s “luminous” beauty and in Hitchcock by the voyeuristic display of half-naked Janet Leigh, who models lingerie from the first scene on.

In Part One, “Seraphitus,” we see the angel in his masculine phase. He is an adolescent ephebe of “brilliant splendor,” his eyes blazing with solar fire. His northland is a visionary realm glittering with “flashes of the ephemeral diamonds produced by the crystallized surface of the snow and ice.”

Balzac’s manipulations of gender are the most complex in literature. Even Woolf’s Orlando, with its midpoint sexchange, treats its androgyne with schematic simplicity, compared to Seraphita’ s flamelike interweaving of objective and subjective gender. Much is lost in translation, since Balzac exploits the grammatical ambiguity of Romance languages: English must choose his or her in pronouns, while French can avoid committing itself.

Female transvestism in its strict sense, says Robert J. Stoller, is “a condition that may not exist.” As for butch lesbians dressing in men’s clothing, “Neither they nor other women have a fetishistic relationship to male apparel: they do not become sexually excited by such objects.”15 Male transvestites are not only sexually stimulated by female clothing but may require it for orgasm, as with the surprising number of heterosexual men who secretly dress up in their wives’ lingerie. Women are not sexual conceptualizers, just as they are not lust-murderers. For women, male clothing means social freedom and authority. For men, female clothing is religious or cultic. It is the costume of the mother, with whom the son unites by ritual impersonation, like priests of Cybele. The female transvestite seeks merely to pass. Do not gaze at her too long, for her disguise is fragile. But the male transvestite is his own best voyeur, exploiting his internalized eye for maximum excitement. The female transvestite arouses others, not herself.

Another chapter of The Painter of Modern Life considers the female persona, for whom Baudelaire espouses extremism in cosmetics. In an inimitably French locution, he scornfully dismisses the idea that rouge should be used sparingly to enhance nature: “Who would dare to assign to art the sterile function of imitating Nature?” Rousseau and Wordsworth shrink into their foxhole. Cosmetics are pure artifice, meant to hide nature’s insulting blemishes and to create “an abstract unity in the color and texture of the skin.” The face is a mask, a canvas on which to paint. Cosmetics must seem unnatural, theatrical. Woman is “an idol,” obliged to appear “magical and supernatural.”

Des Esseintes wants life entirely artistic and artificial. But nature takes her revenge, tormenting him with toothache, nauseating him with his rare perfumes, disordering his delicacy-sated stomach. Unable to eat, Des Esseintes is fed by enema, “the ultimate deviation from the norm” which he relishes as “a happy affront against nature”: “What a slap in the face for old Mother Nature!”36 The novel ends with the ailing aesthete forced to return to society and nature.

There are Caladiums with “swollen, hairy stems” and “huge heart-shaped leaves.” Aurora Borealis with “leaves the colour of raw meat.” Echinopsis with “ghastly pink blossoms” like “the stumps of amputated limbs.” Nidularium, with “sword-shaped petals” and “gaping flesh-wounds.” Cypripedium like a diseased, bent-back “human tongue” in a medical text. Some flowers seem “ravaged by syphilis or leprosy,” others “blistered by burns” or “pitted with ulcers.” To make these “monstrosities,” nature borrows tints of rotting flesh and the “hideous splendours” of gangrene.

In a secret chamber, Raoule builds a shrine to her dead lover. A wax and rubber effigy lies in state on the bed, a Venus seashell. Hair, lashes, teeth, and nails are all real, “torn from a corpse,” as endorsed by Poe. In sometimes male, sometimes female dress, Raoule kisses the statue’s mouth, which moves by “a hidden spring.” Decadent objectification, begun by the High Romantic turn toward art, reaches its final grotesque point. A person has literally become a thing.

The rise of the Romantic objet d’art is paralleled by the social novel’s documentation of objects, rare in eighteenth-century fiction. Balzac opens Père Goriot with a slow, photographic inspection of a squalid rooming house. Character in the social novel, a child of Rousseau, is formed by environment.

Egoism is the androgyne’s raison d’être. Self-complete beings need no one and nothing. Jane Austen’s Emma (1816) illustrates the social novel’s association of androgyny with selfish privatism. Edmund Wilson first pointed out the delicate touch of sexual ambivalence in the beautiful and witty Emma Woodhouse: she is “relatively indifferent to men” and “inclined to infatuations with women.” Marvin Mudrick says, “Emma prefers the company of women, more particularly of women whom she can master and direct; … this preference is intrinsic to her whole dominating and uncommitting personality.” Andrew H. Wright speaks of Emma’s “supreme self-confidence and serene delusion” and Douglas Bush of her “managerial vanity and arrogance.”

“What really defeats her, it seems, is the ordered form and truth of the plot which, from start to finish, meets her at every turn as it maintains its beautiful and inevitable course.”9 In other words, the novel itself, in its formal essence, rises up to check the pretensions of the charismatic personality, humanizing and normalizing it for marriage, foundation of the social order. There is a parallel with English Renaissance literature, where the Amazon sacrifices her androgyny for the public good.

Emma, like Dorian Gray, enchants by a double-sexed charm, to which not all readers are susceptible. But it is the mysterious iridescence of Emma’s half-repellent character that has evoked from commentators on the novel a body of criticism unusual in its fineness. Emma is a reactionary work of Augustan assumptions, and its heroine presides from a tribunal of privilege. Emma’s well-bred aggression becomes crasser in Rebecca Sharp, the upwardly mobile adventuress of Thackeray’s Vanity Fair (1847–48). Becky has Emma’s manipulativeness and Cousin Bette’s cold male will. Her masculine force of personality upstages the nominal heroine, placid, feminine Amelia Sedley. Nevertheless, Vanity Fair, as a social novel, maintains its opposition to glamour, which appears as an amoral hardness.

The Apollonian hierarch is a narcissist, frozen in moral adolescence. Hence Artemis’ and Belphoebe’s boyish body type. Apollonian perfection and fixity are foreign to the social novel, which endorses a developmental model of personality. Developmentalism comes from Rousseau, dramatized in his autobiography. Personality in the social novel must be in evolutionary change, not the same thing as Dionysian metamorphosis.

Dickens, for example, disagrees with George Eliot on several basic issues. His social structures are not educative, leading from self-involvement to community, but oppressive and labyrinthine, emotion-killing. His novels descend from Blake’s protest poems on exploited chimney sweeps. The child is Dickens’ ideal type, uncorrupted, as in Rousseau and Wordsworth, by civilization. His virtuous characters retain the unitary qualities of childhood: innocence, purity, simplicity.

Flaubert said of the heroine of his best novel (1857), “Madame Bovary, c’est moi!” She contains his spiritual struggles and sexual contradictions. Baudelaire felt “a virile spirit” still present in “this bizarre androgyne,” who “remains a man.”11 The motherless Emma sketches Minerva (a self-portrait?), wears masculine accessories, dresses as a man at a ball. Gaston Bachelard says, “The literary creation of a woman by a man or of a man by a woman are burning creations.”12 Madame Bovary carries Flaubert’s adolescent Romantic dreams.

Anna Karenina (1873–76), Tolstoy’s version of Madame Bovary, pits another willful adulteress against social constraint. Emma’s latent masculinity survives in Anna’s severe black-velvet ball dress and in the tendency of women to fall “in love with” or “lose their hearts” to her.13 Society wins; the heroines are defeated. The suicides of Emma, Anna, and Vergil’s Dido may function as an exorcistic divorce of the writer’s adult male persona from the mesmerizing female persona of his inner life, a shadow of mother and memory.

The first novels of Emily and Charlotte Brontë, published the same year, revived out-of-fashion Gothic style. They share rugged, brooding heroes and a wild atmosphere of mystery and gloom. But the books belong to different genres. Despite sex-reversing moments, Charlotte’s Jane Eyre is a social novel governed by public principles of intelligibility. It records the worldly progress of an ingénue from childhood to maturity, culminating in marriage. Emily’s Wuthering Heights, on the other hand, is High Romantic, its sources of energy outside society and its sex and emotion incestuous and solipsistic.

Dorothy van Ghent speaks of “the impulse to destruction” and “the inhuman excess” of Heathcliff and Catherine’s passion, “an excess everywhere present in language—in verbs and modifiers and metaphors that seethe with a brute fury.”18 Virginia Woolf says, “There is love, but it is not the love of men and women.”19 Cecil calls Catherine’s love “sexless,” “as devoid of sensuality as the attraction that draws the tide to the moon, the steel to the magnet.”

As a sexual persona, Heathcliff is modelled on Byron and specifically on Byron’s Manfred, tormented with love for his sister. Wuthering Heights’ incest theme has been long recognized but only sporadically discussed. Catherine and the orphaned Heathcliff grow up in the intimacy of brother and sister. Heathcliff could even be Earnshaw’s bastard son and hence Catherine’s half-brother. But critics have gotten the incest theme backwards by rationalizing it without regard for its High Romantic sources. Heathcliff and Catherine cannot marry, some claim, because of an implicit incest taboo. Yet as we have seen, incest is so indispensable to Romantic consciousness that even when a sibling does not exist, as in Shelley, he or she must be invented. Incest is not a danger to be shunned but a royal empowerment of imagination.

I gave the name allegorical repletion to this style of representation, which I see in Leonardo’s The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and Rossetti’s Bower Meadow and Astarte Syriaca.

Why the sudden reduction of scale and style? Emily Brontë’s sexual metathesis into Heathcliff is inseparable from the incestuous-twin theme. Heathcliff is conceived as one end of an erotic polarity. If Brontë enters her novel as a man, then her feeling for the vanished Catherine is homosexual.

There is persistent imagery of smoothness and softness, of enamoured watching and hushed, eerie nearness.40 Like Christina Rossetti’s strange dream-poem Goblin Market (1862), with its embowered sister-sensuality and lush, fruity dangers, Brontë’s poetry may reflect a premodern sexual state, inflamed but celibate. Visionary nuns have lived in this exalted condition for a thousand years. Emily Brontë seeks clairvoyance, not orgasm, a burning vapor of ghostly cathexis.

The novel’s internal decline is Brontë’s own. In the second half, the monumentality of Heathcliff/Catherine dwindles to a thin pale light in which voices are heard as if from a distance. Romanticism is yielding to Victorianism, the pleasant, ordered present in which Emily Brontë refuses to dwell. Extending and revising High Romanticism, she follows Byron, Shelley, and Keats in electing to die young, at the height of imagination.

Though he had enormous influence on English literature, he has virtually disappeared from the curriculum. Even Victorian poetry courses tend to exclude his most lurid and to me most central poems. But Baudelaire too is censored in French classes in American colleges. The reason is that there is no accepted theory of Decadent art, a gap I am trying to fill. The revolt against Swinburne after the fall of Wilde was part of the modernist defection from classical tradition, which T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land wrongly shows in disarray.

I saw her again looking away each time, or closing her eyes, and I began to cry. Isabelle let herself come, she made you come, but she did not like to come, she did not like the outward signs of orgasm; she didn’t like them in me, and no doubt she liked them even less in herself. Everything coincided: each time I had seen her marvel at the plastic expression of beauty, it was over painters like Raphael, and especially Botticelli: something occasionally tender, but often cold, and always very calm; she had never understood the absolute admiration I had for El Greco, she had never appreciated ecstasy, and I cried profusely because this animal side, this limitless surrender to pleasure and ecstasy, was what I liked best in myself, while I had only contempt for my intelligence, sagacity, and humor. We would never know that infinitely mysterious double look of the couple united in happiness, humbly accepting the presence of organs, and limited joy; we would never truly be lovers.

What was worse, however, was that this ideal of plastic beauty, to which she could never again have access, was going to destroy Isabelle before my very eyes. First of all, there were her breasts, which she could no longer stand (and it’s true they were beginning to droop a bit); then her buttocks, which were following the same course. More and more often, it became necessary to turn off the light; then sexuality itself disappeared. She could no longer stand herself; and, consequently, she could no longer stand love, which seemed to her to be false. I could, however, at the beginning, still get a hard-on, at least a little bit; that too disappeared, and from that moment on, it was over; all that remained was a memory of the deceptively ironical words of the Andalusian poet: Oh, the life men try to live!

They undermined the entire superstructure of their vulnerable love through a lifetime of evasion and subterfuge. Both of them became adept at killing off the best qualities of the other. In some ways, there was something classic and quintessentially American in their marriage. They began as lovers and ended up as the most dangerous and unutterable of enemies. As lovers, they begat children; as enemies, they created damaged, endangered children.

Your only chance of survival, if you are sincerely smitten, lies in hiding this fact from the woman you love, of feigning a casual detachment under all circumstances. What sadness there is in this simple observation! What an accusation against man! However, it had never occurred to me to contest this law, nor to imagine disobeying it: love makes you weak, and the weaker of the two is oppressed, tortured, and finally killed by the other, who in his or her turn oppresses, tortures, and kills without having evil intentions, without even getting pleasure from it, with complete indifference; that’s what men, normally, call love.

Writing makes me happy. But it goes beyond that. Writing is my life’s work. I am absolutely positive that this is what I’m here to do. Even if it turns out that I don’t have the ability, and no one out there wants to read a single word of it, there’s nothing I can do about this feeling. I can’t make it go away. I recognize that luck, effort, and ability are often indistinguishable. And I know that, in the end, I’m just another human being, who’s born only to die.

He referred to synchronicity again in his “Tavistock Lectures” in London, 1935: “… a peculiar principle active in the world so that things happen together somehow and behave as if they were the same, and yet for us they are not.”6 Again in the Lectures he equated it with the Chinese concept of Tao.7 Years later, in his foreword (written before 1950) to the Wilhelm/Baynes translation of the I Ching, Jung gave an exposition of the principle of synchronicity.8 He was already preparing an extended monograph, but his first formal presentation of the theory was a brief lecture—his last—at the Eranos Conference of 1951 at Ascona, Switzerland.9 The monograph was published the following year, together with a monograph by Pauli on “The Influence of Archetypal Ideas on the Scientific Theories of Johannes Kepler.”10 An English translation of the volume, with corrections and extensive revisions by Jung, was subsequently published.11 Jung’s monograph appeared in vol. 8 of the Collected Works in 1960 and, with further revisions by the translator, in the second edition of vol. 8, 1969. It is the latter version that is published here. 1 Jung tells the story in Memories, Dreams, Reflections (New York and London, 1963), pp. 105/108, and in a letter to Professor J. B. Rhine, 27 Nov. 1934, in C. G. Jung: Letters, ed.

But for some obscure reason he does look behind them for something more than mere probability warrants—for a law of seriality which he would like to introduce as a principle coexistent with causality and finality.

Schopenhauer’s attempt is the more remarkable in that it was made at a time when the tremendous advance of the natural sciences had convinced everybody that causality alone could be considered the final principle of explanation. Instead of ignoring all those experiences which refuse to bow down to the sovereign rule of causality, he tried, as we have seen, to fit them into his deterministic view of the world. In so doing, he forced concepts like prefiguration, correspondence, and pre-established harmony, which as a universal order coexisting with the causal one have always underlain man’s explanations of nature, into the causal scheme, probably because he felt—and rightly—that the scientific view of the world based on natural law, though he did not doubt its validity, nevertheless lacked something which played a considerable role in the classical and medieval view (as it also does in the intuitive feelings of modern man).

If one considers, however, that in the Babylonian Hades the souls wore a “feather dress,” and that in ancient Egypt the ba, or soul, was thought of as a bird,39 it is not too far-fetched to suppose that there may be some archetypal symbolism at work.

There also seems to be an archetypal foundation to the first case. It was an extraordinarily difficult case to treat, and up to the time of the dream little or no progress had been made. I should explain that the main reason for this was my patient’s animus, which was steeped in Cartesian philosophy and clung so rigidly to its own idea of reality that the efforts of three doctors—I was the third—had not been able to weaken it. Evidently something quite irrational was needed which was beyond my powers to produce. The dream alone was enough to disturb ever so slightly the rationalistic attitude of my patient. But when the “scarab” came flying in through the window in actual fact, her natural being could burst through the armour of her animus possession and the process of transformation could at last begin to move. Any essential change of attitude signifies a psychic renewal which is usually accompanied by symbols of rebirth in the patient’s dreams and fantasies. The scarab is a classic example of a rebirth symbol.

The ancient Egyptian Book of What Is in the Netherworld describes how the dead sun-god changes himself at the tenth station into Khepri, the scarab, and then, at the twelfth station, mounts the barge which carries the rejuvenated sun-god into the morning sky. The only difficulty here is that with educated people cryptomnesia often cannot be ruled out with certainty (although my patient did not happen to know this symbol). But this does not alter the fact that the psychologist is continually coming up against cases where the emergence of symbolic parallels40 cannot be explained without the hypothesis of the collective unconscious.

Once this is found, the deeper layers of the unconscious, the primordial images, are activated and the transformation of the personality can get under way.

The woman’s psyche is nevertheless involved in so far as the birds settled on her house and were observed by her. For this reason it seems to me probable that her unconscious was in fact constellated. The flock of birds has, as such, a traditional mantic significance.43 This is also apparent in the woman’s own interpretation, and it therefore looks as if the birds represented an unconscious premonition of death.

The unconscious, however, often knows more than the conscious, and it seems to me possible that the woman’s unconscious had already got wind of the danger. If, therefore, we rule out a conscious psychic content such as the idea of deadly danger, there is an obvious simultaneity between the flock of birds, in its traditional meaning, and the death of the husband.

I mean it really changed the way they saw things, as if the strength of how they felt for one another had produced a sturdy faith in how the world would operate. When they gazed into each other’s eyes, they saw a world replete with promise, strong and soft.

Church architecture, country crafts, ornithology, botany and - a slight surprise - theology. He wondered whether this was an expression of faith, or a quest for faith, or simply an obsession with the absence of God.

All these things must have been brought here, or collected here, summer by summer, and then outgrown, but never thrown away, so that the room had become a sort of palimpsest of the young life it contained. He looked at Burns’s sleeping face, and then tiptoed downstairs.

Burns said quietly, ‘Do you know what Christ died of?’ Rivers looked surprised, but answered readily enough. ‘Suffocation. Ultimately the position makes it impossible to go on inflating the lungs. A terrible death.’ ‘That’s what I find so horrifying. Somebody had to imagine that death. I mean, just in order to invent it as a method of execution. You know that thing in the Bible? “The imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth”? I used to wonder why pick on that? Why his imagination? But it’s absolutely right.’

Rivers, going downstairs to make the tea, thought that a curious thing had happened during that conversation. For the first time, Burns had been able to put the decomposing corpse into some kind of perspective. True, he hadn’t managed to talk about it, but at least it hadn’t prevented him, as it so often had in the past, from talking about other, more bearable aspects of his war experience.

Rivers knew only too well how often the early stages of change or cure may mimic deterioration. Cut a chrysalis open, and you will find a rotting caterpillar. What you will never find is that mythical creature, half caterpillar, half butterfly, a fit emblem of the human soul, for those whose cast of mind leads them to seek such emblems. No, the process of transformation consists almost entirely of decay.

think they were. Before the war. Slightly. But it’s not very likely, is it, that any movement towards greater tolerance would persist in wartime? After all, in war, you’ve got this enormous emphasis on love between men - comradeship — and everybody approves. But at the same time there’s always this little niggle of anxiety. Is it the right kind of love? Well, one of the ways you make sure it’s the right kind is to make it crystal clear what the penalties for the other kind are.’ He looked at Sassoon. ‘One of the reasons I’m so glad you’ve decided to go back.

And yet it was often the better type of woman who chose to limit the size of her family, while her feckless sisters bred the Empire to destruction.

soon as he started work at the hospital he became busy and, as Head had predicted, fascinated by the differences in severity of breakdown between the different branches of the RFC. Pilots, though they did indeed break down, did so less frequently and usually less severely than the men who manned observation balloons. They, floating helplessly above the battlefields, unable either to avoid attack or to defend themselves effectively against it, showed the highest incidence of breakdown of any service. Even including infantry officers. This reinforced Rivers’s view that it was prolonged strain, immobility and helplessness that did the damage, and not the sudden shocks or bizarre horrors that the patients themselves were inclined to point to as the explanation for their condition. That would help to account for the greater prevalence of anxiety neuroses and hysterical disorders in women in peacetime, since their relatively more confined lives gave them fewer opportunities of reacting to stress in active and constructive ways.

This eye, where no eye should have been, was deeply disturbing to Prior. For a moment he was back in France, looking at Towers’s eyeball in the palm of his hand.

Not by Germany’ – here he’d thumped the table so hard that plates and cutlery had leapt into the air – ‘NOT BY GERMANY, but by an unholy alliance of socialists, sodomites and shop stewards.’ Prior had felt scarcely able to comment, never having been a shop steward. ‘Do you think that’s relevant?’ ‘It was relevant to me.

He might almost have said with Henry Jekyll, It was on the moral side, and in my own person, that I learned to recognize the thorough and primitive duality of man; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically both . . .

His empathy, his strong sense of the humanity he shared with his patients, was again suspended. A necessary suspension, without which the practice of medical research, and indeed of medicine itself, would hardly be possible, but none the less identifiably the same suspension the soldier must achieve in order to kill.

What Head was doing, Rivers thought, was in some ways a benign, epicritic form of the morbid dissociation that had begun to afflict Prior. Head’s dissociation was healthy because the researcher and the physician each had instant access to the experience of the other, and both had access to Head’s experience in all other areas of his life. Prior’s was pathological because areas of his conscious experience had become inaccessible to memory.

Wantage was the most popular of the orderlies, partly because his built-up boot supplied an instant explanation for why he wasn’t in France. He was a fat, jolly man with a limitless capacity for hate. He hated skivers, he hated shirkers, he hated conchies, he hated the Huns, he hated the Kaiser. He loved the war. He had the gentlest hands in the hospital. He would have given anything to be able to go and fight. Whenever Rivers saw him lurching along behind a wheelchair, he was reminded of the crippled boy in the Pied Piper story, left behind when the other children went into the mountain.

Manning had been admitted because the anxiety attacks he’d suffered ever since his return from France had become more severe, partly as a result of his obsession with the Pemberton Billing affair. Rivers would have liked to tell him to ignore the trial for the farrago of muck-raking nonsense it was, but that was not possible. Manning had been sent a newspaper cutting about Maud Allan and the ‘cult of the clitoris’. More recently he’d received a copy of the 47,000 article. Manning was being targeted, presumably by someone who knew he was a homosexual, and he could hardly be expected to ignore

‘I’m not sure I do. I think it’s the result of certain impulses rising to the surface in wartime, and having to be very formally disowned. Homosexuality, for instance. In war there’s this enormous glorification of love between men, and yet at the same time it arouses anxiety. Is it the right kind of love? Well, one way to make sure it’s the right kind is to make public disapproval of the other thing crystal clear. And then there’s pleasure in killing

She thinks pillorying Maud Allan is actually a way of teaching them a lesson. Not just lesbians. All women.

‘Are you familiar with the strict Freudian view of war neurosis?’ he asked. Manning, he knew, had read a certain amount of Freud. ‘I didn’t know there was one.’ ‘Oh, yes. Basically, they believe the experience of an all-male environment, with a high level of emotional intensity, together with the experience of battle, arouses homosexual and sadistic impulses that are normally repressed. In vulnerable men – obviously those in whom the repressed desires are particularly strong – this leads to breakdown.’

You know, I’ve never served with him so I don’t know this from personal experience, but I’ve talked a lot to Robert Graves and he says the extent to which Sassoon contrives to be two totally different people at the Front is absolutely amazing. You know he’s a tremendously successful and bloodthirsty platoon commander, and yet at the same time, back in billets, out comes the notebook. Another anti-war poem. And the poem uses the experience of the platoon commander, but it never uses any of his attitudes. And yet for once, in that one poem, he gets both versions of himself in.’

Many people, caught in the virtue trap, do not appear to be self-destructive to the casual eye. Bent on being good husbands, fathers, mothers, wives, teachers, whatevers, they have constructed a false self that looks good to the world and meets with a lot of worldly approval. This false self is always patient, always willing to defer its needs to meet the needs or demands of another. (“What a great guy!

It killed, he said to himself, the real flower of the intimacy between him and her. But Connie didn't mind that.

Connie was surprised at her own feeling of aversion from Clifford. What is more, she felt she had always really disliked him. Not hate: there was no passion in it. But a profound physical dislike. Almost, it seemed to her, she had married him because she disliked him, in a secret, physical sort of way. But of course, she had married him really because in a mental way he attracted her and excited her. He had seemed, in some way, her master, beyond her. Now the mental excitement had worn itself out and collapsed, and she was aware only of the physical aversion. It rose up in her from her depths: and she realized how it had been eating her life away.

But the novel, like gossip, can also excite spurious sympathies and recoils, mechanical and deadening to the psyche. The novel can glorify the most corrupt feelings, so long as they are conventionally 'pure'. Then the novel, like gossip, becomes at last vicious, and, like gossip, all the more vicious because it is always ostensibly on the side of the angels. Mrs Bolton's gossip was always on the side of the angels. 'And he was such a bad fellow, and she was such a nice woman.' Whereas, as Connie could see even from Mrs Bolton's gossip, the woman had been merely a mealy-mouthed sort, and the man angrily honest. But angry honesty made a 'bad man' of him, and mealy-mouthedness made a 'nice woman' of her, in the vicious, conventional channelling of sympathy by Mrs Bolton.

WHEN WE RETURNED TO BERKELEY IN JANUARY 1968, THE CHANGE WAS everywhere evident. People even looked different. Peace symbols and crystal pendants had replaced crucifixes and Stars of David as emblems of religious conviction. Clothes were tie-dyed and bucolic, colors psychedelic, and hair long. (I immediately felt betrayed by Scheer’s orders to get mine cut.) To liberate themselves from the old sexual order, women were going bra-less, a protest whose immediate effect was to raise the libidinal pulses of everyday life. At the south end of campus, hippie craftsmen had transformed Telegraph Avenue into a street fair, where musicians and jugglers “doing their thing” attracted crowds for the tradesmen. It all had the air of a medieval pastoral, like the Forest of Arden in Shakespeare’s As You Like It, where there were no menacing creatures, or hungers that could not be satisfied.

Newton became a leader of the new generation of activists, who were turning their backs on the nonviolent, integrationist preachings of Martin Luther King, just as Don Warden had predicted they would in the first issue of Root and Branch. Led by Stokeley Carmichael and the Black Muslim leader Malcolm X, they identified themselves as “blacks” and called for “Black Power,” reserving the word Negro for “Uncle Toms,” among whom they included Martin Luther King (whom the Panthers referred to as Martin Luther Coon). Malcolm X called King’s historic march on Washington “ridiculous” and predicted that white America would never grant the full citizenship that had been promised. Malcolm’s racist doctrines and violent solutions made him marginal to the civil-rights struggle, and caused him to be shunned by its leadership. King himself had refused to appear with the Muslim leader in public. It was only in the year before Malcolm’s death that he broke with the Nation of Islam and appeared to moderate his stance on race by holding out the possibility of a revolutionary alliance with radical whites.

To distinguish their radical outlook from that of the then-moderate National Organization of Women and other liberal groups, they called their agenda “women’s liberation.” Elissa came home from the first session in a state of agitation, vowing never to return. “They hate me because I’m a mother,” was all she said. Years later I learned from other members of the group that they had berated her for allowing me to “oppress” her by “making” her assume the housewifely role. They also told me that within a year of the group’s formation, every marriage in it had dissolved.

What had begun as a move to institute economies that would save all our jobs turned into a prosecution. Accusations of laziness, dishonesty, and exploitation of fellow workers were hurled at the hapless defendants. In the end, they were made to feel so bad about what they had done that firing them was almost a mercy. It was a collectively supported, brutal exercise, necessary for us to prevail. Privately, this experience made me recognize the utility and compassion inherent in the principle of hierarchy we had overthrown.

Avakian stared blankly at me while I rehearsed the long and tortured history of the conflict about which he had written, going back to the 1930s with Stalin’s intervention in the Chinese revolution. I stressed the totalitarian character of both parties, and the danger to the American left of unthinkingly supporting either’s claims. Avakian was unimpressed. It turned out he had copied his article, almost word for word, out of Peking Review, which provided all the information he cared to know. Later, he went on to found the Revolutionary Communist Party, and to become its chairman for life, meticulously reproducing the political style of his Maoist icons.

On another occasion, Scheer’s ex-wife, Anne Weills, submitted a feminist review she had written of Visconti’s film The Damned. Its images of the Holocaust, she wrote, had inspired her to reflect on the oppression of women. When I rejected the article, she came angrily into the office to protest. Explaining my decision, I suggested—as gently as the circumstance permitted—that her analogy between Hitler’s final solution and men’s attitudes toward women might be overdrawn. Instead of responding to the point, she defended her text on the grounds that “Women don’t think in a linear way.” “Susan Sontag,” I replied, “seems to manage it quite well.” This ended the discussion.

The episode made me realize that the Left had its own generational problem. The activists who had seized center stage in the revolutionary moment of 1968, and for whom the Weathermen were a radical archetype, were ten years younger than we were, the SLA members probably another five. They had a bigger appetite for violence than we did, and had never heard of the Khrushchev Report. Above all, they had no sense of the abyss over which every revolutionary act was suspended—the fratricide and nihilism ready to erupt from the breakdown of social order and the breakthrough to the other side.

A woman’s issues of soul cannot be treated by carving her into a more acceptable form as defined by an unconscious culture, nor can she be bent into a more intellectually acceptable shape by those who claim to be the sole bearers of consciousness. No, that is what has already caused millions of women who began as strong and natural powers to become outsiders in their own cultures.

So, the word wild here is not used in its modern pejorative sense, meaning out of control, but in its original sense, which means to live a natural life, one in which the criatura, creature, has innate integrity and healthy boundaries. These words, wild and woman, cause women to remember who they are and what they are about. They create a metaphor to describe the force which funds all females. They personify a force that women cannot live without.

In biology it would be called the typical or fundamental nature. But because it is tacit, prescient, and visceral, among cantadoras it is called the wise or knowing nature. It is sometimes called the “woman who lives at the end of time,” or the “woman who lives at the edge of the world.” And this criatura is always a creator-hag, or a death Goddess, or a maiden in descent, or any number of other personifications.

This is our meditation practice as women, calling back the dead and dismembered aspects of ourselves, calling back the dead and dismembered aspects of life itself. The one who re-creates from that which has died is always a double-sided archetype. The Creation Mother is always also the Death Mother and vice versa. Because of this dual nature, or double-tasking, the great work before us is to learn to understand what around and about us and what within us must live, and what must die. Our work is to apprehend the timing of both; to allow what must die to die, and what must live to live.

Ah, now this tiny key; it provides entry to the secret all women know and yet do not know. The key represents permission to know the deepest, darkest secrets of the psyche, in this case the something that mindlessly degrades and destroys a woman’s potential. Bluebeard continues his destructive plan by instructing his wife to compromise herself psychically; “Do whatever you like,” he says. He prompts the woman to feel a false sense of freedom. He implies she is free to nourish herself and to revel in bucolic landscapes, at least within the confines of his territory. But in reality, she is not free, for she is constrained from registering the sinister knowledge about the predator, even though deep in the psyche she already truly comprehends the issue.

To forbid a woman to use the key to conscious self knowledge strips away her intuitive nature, her natural instinct for curiosity that leads her to discover “what lies underneath” and beyond the obvious. Without this knowing, the woman is without proper protection. If she attempts to obey Bluebeard’s command not to use the key, she chooses death for her spirit. By choosing to open the door to the ghastly secret room, she chooses life.

The door in the tale is portrayed as a psychic barrier, as a kind of sentry that is placed in front of the secret. This guard reminds us again of the predator’s reputation as a mage—a psychic force that twists and tangles us up as though by magic, keeping us from knowing what we know. Women strengthen this barrier or door when they discourage themselves or one another from thinking or diving too deeply, for “you may get more than you bargained for.” In order to breach this barrier, a proper counter-magic must be employed. And the fitting magic is found in the symbol of the key.

Asking the proper question is the central action of transformation—in fairy tales, in analysis, and in individuation. The key question causes germination of consciousness. The properly shaped question always emanates from an essential curiosity about what stands behind. Questions are the keys that cause the secret doors of the psyche to swing open.

Though the sisters know not whether treasure or travesty lies beyond the door, they summon their goodly instincts to ask the precise psychological question, “Where do you think that door is, and what might lie beyond it?” It is at this point that the naive nature begins to mature, to question, “What is behind the visible? What is it which causes that shadow to loom upon the wall?” The youthful naive nature begins to understand that if there is a secret something, if there is a shadow something, if there is a forbidden something, it needs to be looked into. Those who would develop consciousness pursue all that stands behind the readily observable: the unseen chirping, the murked window, the lamenting door, the lip of light beneath a sill. They pursue these mysteries until the substance of the matter is laid open to them.

So though the young woman attempts to follow the orders of the predator, and agrees to be ignorant about the secret in the cellar, she can only comply for so long. Finally she puts the key, the question, to the door and finds the shocking carnage in some part of her deep life. And that key, that tiny symbol of her life, suddenly will not cease its bleeding, will not cease to give the cry that something is wrong. A woman may try to hide from the devastations of her life, but the bleeding, the loss of life’s energy, will continue until she recognizes the predator for what it is and contains it.

This is a powerful archetypal process in women’s psyches. The woman is adequately perceptive, and though she too at first agrees to marry that natural predator of the psyche, and although she too goes through a period of being lost in the psyche, she wills out at the end, for she is able to see into the truth of it all, and she is able to hold it in consciousness and take action to resolve the matter.

Here we are again at La Loba’s place, at the archetypal bone woman’s cave. Here we have the remnants of what once was the full woman. However, unlike the cyclical life and death aspects of the Wild Woman archetype who takes the life that is ready to die, incubates it, and hurls it back into the world again, Bluebeard only kills and dismantles a woman until she is nothing but bones. He leaves her no beauty, no love, no self, and therefore no ability to act in her own behalf. To remedy this, we as women must look to the killing thing that has gained hold of us, see the result of its grisly work, register it all consciously, and retain it in consciousness, and then act in our, not its, behalf.

numinous Self slips away. In Bluebeard, the psyche now tries to avoid being killed. No longer naive, it has become cunning; it pleads for time to compose itself—in other words, time to strengthen itself for the final battle. In outer reality, we find women planning their escapes too, whether from an old destructive mode, a lover, or a job. She stalls for time, she bides her time, she plans her strategy and calls up her power internally, before she makes an external change.

When women resurface from their naïveté, they draw with them and to themselves something unexplored. In this case the now wiser woman draws an internal masculine energy to her aid. In Jungian psychology, this element has been named animus; a partly mortal, partly instinctual, partly cultural element of a woman’s psyche that shows up in fairy tales and in dream symbols as her son, husband, stranger, and/or lover—possibly threatening depending on her psychic circumstances of the moment. This psychic figure is particularly valuable because it is invested with qualities which are traditionally bred out of women, aggression being one of the more common. When this opposite-gender nature is healthy, as symbolized by the brothers in “Bluebeard,” it loves the woman it inhabits. It is the intra-psychic energy which helps her to accomplish anything she asks. He is the one who has psychic muscle where she may have differing gifts. He will aid and assist her in her bid for consciousness. For many women, this contra-sexual aspect bridges between the worlds of internal thought and feeling—the outer world.

The stronger and more integrally vast the animus (think of the animus as a bridge) the more able, easily, and with style the woman manifests her ideas and her creative work in the outer world in a concrete way. A woman with a poorly developed animus has lots of ideas and thoughts but is unable to manifest them in the outer world. She always stops short of the organization or implementation of her wonderful images.

Bluebeard is one of several teaching tales that I believe are important for women who are young, not necessarily in years, but in some part of their minds. It is a tale of psychic naïveté, but also of powerfully breaching the injunction against “looking.” It is a tale about finally cutting down and rendering the natural predator of the psyche.

Women find that as they vanquish the predator, taking from it what is useful and leaving the rest, they are filled with intensity, vitality, and drive. They have rendered from the predator what has been stolen from them, vigor and substance. To render the predator’s energy and turn it to something useful can be understood in these ways: The predator’s rage can be rendered into a soul-fire for accomplishing a great task in the world. The predator’s craftiness can be used to inspect and understand things from a distance. The predator’s killing nature can be used to kill off that which must properly die in a woman’s life, or what she must die to in her outer life, these being different things at different times. Usually, she knows exactly what they are. To render the parts of Bluebeard is like taking the medicinal parts of the deadly nightshade, or the healing elements of the poisonous belladonna plant, and using these materials carefully and for healing and helping. What ash of the predator is left then will indeed rise up again, but in much smaller form, much more recognizably, and with much less power to deceive and destroy—for you have rendered many of its powers which it plied destructively, and you have turned these powers toward the useful and the relevant.

The dark man dream is a scary dream, and scary dreams are most often very good for creativity; they show the artist what will happen to them if they allow themselves to be fried up into talented derelicts. This dark man dream is often enough to scare a woman back into creating again. At the very least, she can create work which elucidates the dark man in her own dreams. The threat of the dark man serves as a warning to all of us—if you don’t pay attention to the treasures, they will be stolen from you. In this manner,

Women are often highly ambivalent about aggression toward the intruder, for they think it is a “damned if I do, damned if I don’t” situation. If she doesn’t break away, the dark man becomes her keeper and she his slave. If she does break away, he pursues her relentlessly, as though he owns her. Women fear that he will hunt them down in order to bring them back into submission, and this fear is reflected in the contents of their dreams.

To my mind, the old Russian tale “Vasalisa”1 is a woman’s initiation story with few essential bones astray. It is about the realization that most things are not as they seem. As women we call upon our intuition and instincts in order to sniff things out. We use all our senses to wring the truth from things, to extract nourishment from our own ideas, to see what there is to see, to know what there is to know, to be the keepers of our own creative fires, and to have intimate knowing about the Life/Death/Life cycles of all nature—this is an initiated woman.

So all aspects of the story belong to and elucidate an individual psyche undergoing an initiatory process. Initiation is enacted by completing certain tasks.

Vasalisa began with what we might call a flattened-out mundane personality. It is just this “hyper-normalcy” that creeps up on us till we have a routine life, and a lifeless life without our really meaning to. This encourages the neglect of intuition13 which in turn produces lack of light in the psyche. We must do something then, we must set out into the woods, go find the scary woman, or else one day as we are nodding down the street a manhole cover will snap open and whoosh we will be snatched by some unconscious thing that will throw us about like a rag—joyously or otherwise, mostly otherwise, but for good outcome.14

Women’s cycles according to Vasalisa’s tasks are these: To cleanse one’s thinking, renewing one’s values, on a regular basis. To clear one’s psyche of trivia, sweep one’s self, clean up one’s thinking and feeling states on a regular basis. To build an enduring fire beneath the creative life, and cook up ideas on a systematic basis, means especially to cook, and with originality, a lot of unprecedented life in order to feed the relationship between oneself and the wildish nature.

One could say that in myth the figures are confused with the gods of religion; they correspond to what Lucien Lévy-Bruhl calls représentations collectives. Fairy tales, on the contrary, migrate and cannot be linked up with a national collective consciousness. They rather contain a tremendous amount of compensatory material and usually contradict or compensate collective conscious ideas.

Supposing there is an experience of a feminine goddess who has all the features of the Earth Mother, but is as sexually extravagant as Baubo was in Grecian times. If you were brought up as a Catholic, you cannot call this figure the Virgin Mary. But since that is the only representative you have of the feminine numinous figure, you must continue to call her the Mother or give her a fantastic name, say “Little Mother Evergreen.” But that is not an official name, and we do not worship such a personage. In this way, fairy tales are to a great extent built up by inner experiences which do not quite fit the représentations collectives. Therefore, figures usually have no names, or odd names, but not the names of religious symbols or known systems. They give us more information about what is going on in the compensatory function of the unconscious than myths do.

This seeming distortion is not what it appears to be, but has to do with the law of compensation, which, according to Jung’s discovery, characterizes the products of the unconscious. Dreams either compensate for the lopsidedness of our conscious view or complement its lacunae. Fairy tales, because they are also mostly unsophisticated products of the storyteller’s unconscious, do the same. Like dreams, they help to keep our conscious attitude in a healthy balance, and have therefore a healing function.

As the conscious religious views of Western Europe in the past two thousand years have not given enough expression of the feminine principle, we can expect to find an especially rich crop of archetypal feminine figures in fairy tales giving expression to the neglected feminine principle. We can also expect to retrieve from them quite a few lost goddesses of pagan antiquity.

we certainly have to do with a very archaic and very archetypal motif, and you naturally see the idea of a feminine figure remaining dormant and reappearing after a time. For instance, there is the Demeter myth, in which Persephone disappears in winter and in spring returns to her mother on the surface of the earth—that is, of a girl goddess who disappears into death, or sleep, and returns at a certain time.

These variations are probably written with the feeling that the original tale was too simple, that things could not be as simple as all that. Just to go through a hedge of roses does not seem to be a heroic enough deed. This shows how fairy tales can be mixed up with different archetypal motifs.

the antique tale “Amor and Psyche,” the girl goddess is badly persecuted by her future mother-in-law, the goddess Venus, characterized as the Great Mother figure, like Ishtar and Atargatis. Here we have an interesting variation, for Venus persecutes out of jealousy because Psyche is said to be more beautiful—as in “Snow White.” People worship the girl Psyche instead of the mother Venus. Psyche is thought to be an incarnation of Venus. But because Venus resents the existence of a living human incarnation of herself, she persecutes her. This is an interesting development in Western and Mediterranean civilization.

The same tendency can be seen in the development of the antique mother goddess who wants to incarnate in a human daughter, but the impulse remained abortive. It has nowhere been carried through and become a religious event. The cult of the mother goddess got stuck and suppressed and then reappeared later in the cult of the Virgin Mary, but with great mental reservations and precautions for disinfection of her dark aspect. She was once more admitted, but only insofar as the Church Fathers approved, and if she behaved.

we study the antique mother goddesses who disliked their own human figures of incarnation, we see that the conflict may be characterized in the following way: the mother goddesses depict absolutely unreflecting femininity. They simply personify elemental emotional feminine reactions. If their husband had a love affair with another woman, they made a terrible scene (like Hera). We women must admit that without the brake of consciousness we should do the same, for that is the elemental reaction. The mother goddess always behaved like that. But, at the same time, she behaved with charity; everything poor, lamed, and unhappy was taken on her lap and loved and nursed.

For the development of Western civilization, it was perhaps necessary for the Western mind to have to ignore the mother goddess for a certain length of time and to put the whole emphasis onto male development. But ignored organs of the psyche behave in the same way as ignored organs of the body—if you eat irregularly, your stomach is upset. Our physical organs need a certain amount of attention; we cannot afford to ignore their needs by onesidedness. And the same is true of the organs of the psyche.

Animus possession in a woman annoys men madly; they go up in the air at once. But what really gets the man’s goat is this undertone of lamenting reproachfulness. Men who know a little more about this know that eighty-five percent of animus possession in women is a disguised appeal for love, although unfortunately it has the wrong effect, since it chases away the very love that is wanted. Underneath the animus there is a feeling of reproach and at the same time of wanting to get back at the one who has hurt you. It is a vicious circle, and arguing develops into a typical animus scene. Thus the ignored femininity which plays up in a woman’s anger is something archetypal.

As our story is a collective and not a personal story, we have to find out where it is typical of our civilization, where some aspect of the mother goddess, of feminine nature, has been consciously ignored in Christianity. The most obvious fact, which has become a problem in modern times, is sexuality. Under the ecclesiastical law of social order, it is said to be dangerous and the cause of much trouble; it destroys marriages and so forth. It should be brought under control by law and be permitted only in marriage. That is the Catholic view, which also says that total abstinence would be better, or that sex should be allowed only for the procreation of children and anything else is sinful. But you cannot just decide by sitting at a round table how a god (sexuality) has to be ruled, which is a tremendous error in the Christian system, resulting in the god’s starting to develop autonomous activities.

Not only the god of sexuality—if one can use such a term—has been ignored, but also some of the needs of feminine life. It is well known that there is far more trouble over chastity in convents than in monasteries, so that the possibility of giving up the woman’s side of the order has been seriously discussed. Apparently women have greater difficulty in this respect. Men can more easily do some hurt to their nature and are less harmed than women.

It seems to me that here there is a concrete feminine need. A man’s élan for spiritual interests can carry him along and away from his body. This difference between men and women is symbolized in mythology by the gods of the sun and moon: the sun being the masculine mind and the moon the feminine.

This difference between men and women is symbolized in mythology by the gods of the sun and moon: the sun being the masculine mind and the moon the feminine. Looked at naively, one can say that the sun is reliable. It rises regularly, whereas the moon is moody. It comes up every evening an hour later and fades and wanes and disappears.

Themis (Justice) is the one who is hurt, who curses the child and has the function of the bad fairy godmother. She represents an aspect of the mother goddess which has been very much forgotten in our civilization, but which exists in many primitive civilizations, and in antiquity, that is, a feminine principle which contains a strange kind of severity and revengefulness, and which does not coincide with the parallel male attitude. When we think of revenge or punishment—revenge is an older form of punishment—we think of the law, of its transgression, and of punishment according to established laws, for that is our custom.

To make laws and decide what is to happen to those who break them is in our countries a man’s way of dealing with the problem. Our laws are based on Roman law and patriarchal mentality, so that we always think of punishment as having to do with the masculine world, and of women as representing the principle of charity and the making of exceptions.

That is a defense against an overgrowth of evil, but it is a one-sided way of looking at the problem. According to mythological standards, there is also feminine justice, and a feminine principle of revenge. What would that be, according to the rules of law and justice as we see them? It would be more individual and personal.

In most primitive mythologies, there is an aspect of the feminine goddess of nature known as Nemesis—Revenge, Fate; and Themis—Justice. The principle of justice in the Jewish Kabbalah belongs also to the left, that is, to the feminine side of the Sefiroth tree. So justice is a feminine quality according to Jewish symbolism, which seems very strange.

It cannot be called a legal punishment; it is the natural consequence—wrong behavior is followed by bad luck or illness. Punishment and revenge are not brought about only by humans, but also by a process of revenge in nature. Sometimes the same thing happens psychologically too. A wrong attitude, not necessarily immoral but one not in accordance with nature, is also avenged, and the person will have bad luck, though no moral law has been broken.

I know the mother of an eight-year-old girl who is very lively and rather lonely, and always wants her mother to play with her. On her free afternoon the mother parks the child out. At the last minute, however, the child always wants something. For instance, she is clever enough to say that she has done her sums—which she hates doing—and wants her mother to check them. From a rational point of view, the mother should help the child with her schoolwork. But in this case, from the feminine standpoint, the mother is right, for on the child’s part it is a calculated trick to keep her mother at home. Outwardly, of course, it looks completely wrong, if the child’s request seems rational and just. When the situation is rationally on the side of the child, it needs a certain subtlety to be able to say that the mother is right. There comes the great question of whether she should follow the motivation underneath and just be nasty, or the upper, which is wrong for her.

It is a tragic fact that the structure of man is such that perseverance is necessary to maintain the principle of consciousness. But it is just this persistence which brings about dissociation. The only issue here would be the Jungian attitude: to know of these difficulties and try to develop a greater flexibility and a more open attitude within one’s conscious attitude, to follow one’s instinct only until one has a clear message to the contrary from the unconscious, which may indicate that one should move over a little to the other side.

Here the difficulty is that this flexible attitude may be confused with infantile unsteadiness. There is a kind of infantile incapacity for sticking to things. The person changes and wobbles, which denotes a weak ego consciousness, an either/and/or attitude incapable of steering a steady course. To people who act in this way, the wisdom of Jungian psychology—that is, of balancing between the opposites—is sheer poison; for it is used to justify a lack of backbone and a weak consciousness. It becomes an attempt to justify the infantile unsteadiness by quoting Jung and the principle of opposites.

To return to our story. The angry fairy godmother curses the child, saying that she will die on her fifteenth birthday; but another godmother softens the curse into one that she should sleep for a hundred years. Sleep and death were two gods who in antiquity were looked upon as divine brothers: Hypnos and Thanatos. The ancients saw sleep as a kind of death, and therefore in this story they have to be taken relatively.

Puberty is an age when neurotic attitudes often break out. It then looks as if a part of femininity was allowed to develop as far as the juvenile plane and not beyond. The feminine element which does not quite fit in a civilization is allowed to live through childhood, but not when it gets to the age of being taken seriously in the adult world.

The savior phantasy in mothers is very often at the bottom of the destruction of the son, for it affects the boy. The mother must spin the right kind of phantasy, neither overvaluing nor undervaluing the child, keeping it rightly in her mind and heart, and then it can go its own way.

Frequently one comes across women who say, “Well, you see, I somehow assumed that I should never get married,” or “I was stupid, for I never managed to do anything in life.” One asks, “Why did you assume that?” God knows! In early youth such a self-destructive conviction was arrived at and never discussed with anybody or expressed in any way. From then on, the whole inner development with the possibilities of creating or of becoming something or somebody vanishes, just as Briar Rose vanished after pricking herself. You can only see that something has stopped in such people; they seem asleep and move along under a dark fate, one does not know why.

When the prince appears after a hundred years, the thorny hedge growing around the castle blossoms suddenly into beautiful roses. The rose, says one medieval author, belongs to the goddess Venus and means love, for “there is no love without thorns.” They also say “Ubi mel, ibi fel,” where there is honey, there is also the bitter gall. You can refer the meaning of the thorn to the terrible involuntary hurts loving people always inflict upon each other. There is the expression “a typical lovers’ quarrel.’’ We would call it an anima-animus quarrel, the sword crossing of animus and anima, which consists in a most horrible way of hurting each other in the most vulnerable spots. Just where the man has a most uncertain delicate feeling, the woman places the thorn of her animus; and where the woman wants to be understood or accepted, the man comes out with some anima poison dart.

What should be a receptive, loving attitude becomes a thorny hedge, where every man who tries to penetrate gets so torn that he just retires. A man cannot get at such a touchy woman who is hurt by the most harmless remark. It is too complicated, and naturally he gives up, like the men in the fairy tale.

One could say this illustrates that the problem of touchy domination has to be treated with patience and waiting.

I have seen this happen at thirty, thirty-six, or forty. They just leave their touchy cage and marry happily—and the thing goes quite well, without analysis. It is just as though they at first waited too long, but then caught up. It is like a delayed or late development due to their delicacy or sensitiveness. Analysis would not help such people; they just had to sleep and then wake up. Sometimes the best thing to do with such a bachelor type is to send him away and say he is O.K.—he should just wait until he finds a woman who suits him.

One of the ways in which the feminine world defends and establishes itself in its own right is by creating a feminine paradise. You see this sometimes in women’s clubs where the women sit together and talk about their little concerns, ignoring or excluding the man’s world. You can see it also in families where the mother and daughters get together and play among themselves, scorning the father and brothers a little, saying that men must get out of the kitchen; men are big babies, or fools.

Particularly if girls have a rather delicate, feminine nature underneath do they hide it behind tomboy manners. I taught boys and girls of that age for a long time, and observed that the girls who wore such bearskins were much more alert and interested in school and that their marks went down as soon as they started a love life, dating boys, and became more interested in love. Those to whom this happened later had a better chance of developing a certain amount of personality than those who went into the other side too early.

I had this same feeling of entering into another temporality two other times in my life, with Jean-Claude Brisseau and Philippe Garrel. Three absolutely obsessional filmmakers whom you approach as if you were approaching a bonfire. The things that don't exist in their eyes (social networks, other people's cinema, television, emails, whatever) don't exist, period. In their orbit, they make their ideas prevail, without exerting any kind of authority. Simply by their way of being concentrated on themselves, of talking only about the three or four things that matter in their lives, their cinema. It's an intransigence that reframes you, sets you straight. You leave thinking that you have to live by these obsessions, and not by other things. You have to sort through it, clear the decks.

It says PRIVATE on the top of them. Probably private, then. Probably letters that Tom has written to Jas. Very personal, and private; I’d better put them away. 5:16 p.m. She calls him HUNKY! That is hilariously crap! Absolutemento pathetico!!! HUNKY!!!Tom!!! Hahahahahaha. 5:18 p.m. He calls her Po!!! Like in the Teletubbies.

“Most women have become self-sufficient in regards to their needs. When they discover a need, they provide if for themselves.” “That works fine — if it is something you can give yourself,” she pointed out. “When women discover they have needs that must come from another — for love, attention, touch, help — they can be stymied. They will often try to talk themselves out of it. If they cannot, next they will try to figure out who owes that to them, because of something they did for that person, or sacrificed for that person.” “In other words, they will try to figure out how they deserve it. And from whom they should demand it,” Claudia concluded.

The feel of the soft fabric, the movement of the skirt on her legs, the vibrant teal color. She’d felt light on her feet and flirty. Playful, she realized and remembered seeing the look on Jack’s face, reflected in the glass of a framed award. Yes! Perfect thing to wear tonight.

HELP is a word that interrupts Single Focus. A man will come running, sword drawn. It’s not shameful to need help. It means you’re in over your head, which happens when you have goals and projects. Men are often honored to help someone they admire. “Helpless” means everyday life overwhelms you. Not good. Men will respond but rarely commit. They dread the loss of energy. A sincere “Will you help me?” will get the response: “Yes, what?” or “Yes, how?” or “Yes, when?” SAVING is HELP in an emergency. If it could have been prevented or anticipated, the SAVING will come with a lecture. It takes a lot more energy to SAVE than HELP.

“When what he provides never amounts to more than the energy he spends, a man says, ‘I can’t win.’ And men have been defeated by women’s ‘issues’ for decades. Give him a problem, and truly let him solve it, and he will be happy. But spare him an issue.”

Women have been acculturated to believe that they should be their own heroes. Women’s television delivers this message over and over again with movies in which, at most, one good man might provide some small assistance as the heroine rescues herself.”

The Soul of a man is a Hero. It’s there from birth. Men get to be Heroes when they Provide for us, being Accountable. When they give us what we Need. When they Help us. And Save us. They may think it only counts if they save a life But they save our lives every day — from drudgery, loneliness, fear, despair. Heroism is in the Act; Hero is in the acknowledgment. Queens have always been the ones to acknowledge Heroes.

Giving up the capacity for expressing one’s rage is as hard as giving up any other neurotic symptom; for people are often in love with their berserk quality and won’t give it up in order to become sober and reasonable.

but in the innermost corner of the personality something rises up and the fight is necessary. If people have no conviction of their right to live, you can get them nowhere in an analysis. There is such a thing as having the right to defend oneself and to fight not to be overthrown by the animus of the mother or some other wickedness in the surroundings, and those who cannot do it are really sick.

Though there is no Gothic manor house, the story’s bleak atmosphere and ferocious weather resemble those of the great Bronte novels, which are the literary ancestors of Rebecca. Hitchcock’s luminous, muted technicolor in The Birds, like the eerie sunlight of the San Francisco street scenes of Vertigo (1958), turns fright and anxiety into strange beauty.

Melanie Daniels, ‘a wealthy, shallow playgirl’ (in Hitchcock’s words) whose flirtatious games end in her own traumatic humiliation.4 The screenplay also curiously adds a clinging, manipulative, widowed mother, a theme based on Hitchcock’s own early family experience that obsessively runs through his work. Neither sexual intrigue nor Freudian family romance plays any part in du Maurier’s stripped-down original conception.

Hitchcock’s use of the peculiarly unforgettable name Bodega Bay has poetic resonance: as a metaphor, ‘Bodega Bay’, evoking both nature and culture, stands for all of human life.

In a memoir about the making of Psycho, Janet Leigh describes how Hitchcock had offices and homes in Phoenix extensively photographed, even including a typical young working woman’s closet, bureau and suitcases, to ensure the precise realism of Leigh’s character, Marion.

This exhaustive prior research into externals, which Leigh says was vital to her characterization, was the polar opposite of the internalizing, Stanislavskian ‘Method’ style of acting that had gained so much prestige since the rise of Marlon Brando that even Marilyn Monroe was making pilgrimages to the Actors’ Studio in New York to learn it.

He told François Truffaut: ‘I had every inhabitant of Bodega Bay – man, woman, and child – photographed for the costume department. The restaurant is an exact copy of the one up there.’ The interior of Dan Fawcett’s farmhouse is ‘an exact replica’ of one near Bodega Bay, and ‘even the scenery of the mountain that is shown outside the window of the corridor is completely accurate’. The schoolteacher’s house combines a schoolteacher’s home in San Francisco with one from the bay, because she ‘works in Bodega Bay but she comes from San Francisco’.17 Before the script was written, Hitchcock visited Bodega Bay: ‘The whole thing was based on the geography.’

Hitchcock’s scholarly attention to the physical world – his pragmatic exactitude and visionary virtuosity, which none of his legion of imitators has understood or been able to duplicate – may have been intensifying in that period. In a memoir about the making of Psycho, Janet Leigh describes how Hitchcock had offices and homes in Phoenix extensively photographed, even including a typical young working woman’s closet, bureau and suitcases, to ensure the precise realism of Leigh’s character, Marion.

Hitchcock was actively involved in costuming Hedren for The Birds: for example, her expensive gold jewellery was personally chosen by him. ‘Hitchcock had a fondness for simple and elegant things like scarves and mink coats,’ said Edith Head, ‘so these things also became part of her wardrobe.’

She’s in one of her best dresses, sky blue with embroidery in white along the edges of the veil: flowers and fretwork. Even at her age she still feels the urge to wreathe herself in flowers. No use for you, I think at her, my face unmoving, you can’t use them anymore, you’re withered. They’re the genital organs of plants. I read that somewhere, once.

Serena Joy’s perfume: Lily of the Valley. Perfume is a luxury, she must have some private source. I breathe it in, thinking I should appreciate it. It’s the scent of prepubescent girls, of the gifts young children used to give their mothers, for Mother’s Day; the smell of white cotton socks and white cotton petticoats, of dusting powder, of the innocence of female flesh not yet given over to hairiness and blood. It makes me feel slightly ill,

we walk away I know they’re watching, these two men who aren’t yet permitted to touch women. They touch with their eyes instead and I move my hips a little, feeling the full red skirt sway around me. It’s like thumbing your nose from behind a fence or teasing a dog with a bone held out of reach, and I’m ashamed of myself for doing it, because none of this is the fault of these men, they’re too young.

It’s like thumbing your nose from behind a fence or teasing a dog with a bone held out of reach, and I’m ashamed of myself for doing it, because none of this is the fault of these men, they’re too young. Then I find I’m not ashamed after all. I enjoy the power; power of a dog bone, passive but there. I hope they get hard at the sight of us and have to rub themselves against the painted barriers, surreptitiously. They will suffer, later, at night, in their regimented beds. They have no outlets now except themselves, and that’s a sacrilege. There are no more magazines, no more films, no more substitutes; only me and my shadow, walking away from the two men, who stand at attention, stiffly, by a roadblock, watching our retreating shapes.
